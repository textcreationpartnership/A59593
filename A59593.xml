            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I deſigned the publication of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Treatiſe, it was my reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to preſent it to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as once I notified to you, which I have now preſumed to
<pb facs="tcp:100221:3"/> put in execution, though then I had not your expreſs licence to prefix your Honour's name, yet by ſome expreſſions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, I conceived you would not be offended if I did. Upon this preſumptive allowance as I was encouraged, ſo upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obligations I was engaged to doe it. I have received high reſpects from your Lordſhip upon ſeveral occaſions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which I ought, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever an opportunity was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to acknowledge with all due veneration, neither could I pitch on a more fitter than this, how mean and little ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is. The old Rule was, He who could make no better payment, ſhould readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the debt; <hi>Reddit, qui liben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter debet,</hi> holds ſtill good with
<pb facs="tcp:100221:3"/> noble and generous Spirits. But this is onely a debt of gratitude and common hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and an argument of good nature to honour thoſe who have deſerved honour: but an higher obligation from a more divine principle is due from an inferiour Prieſt to his Dioceſan. That Order, Let nothing be done, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, without the permiſſion or conſent of the Biſhop (I wiſh it were better obſerved) is ſo ſtrongly bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that, I think, every Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate (without offence, I hope, to the greateſt Rectors or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars) is to apply himſelf in all doubts and emergent caſes of difficulty to his Dioceſan for reſolution; and all his Clergy ſhould in all publick Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings have either his expreſs,
<pb facs="tcp:100221:4"/> or reaſonably preſumed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, eſpecially if they be ſuch as this Treatiſe makes a ſhew of, <hi>viz.</hi> The aſſerting the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of our Reformed Church for its ſtrength and beauty, ſurpaſſing all others both for ſoundneſs of Doctrine, purity and comelineſs of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Apoſtolicalneſs of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. A Church for this reaſon, the more excellent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe moſt oppoſed; for as the hardeſt things are the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, ſo the moſt excellent are moſt aimed and ſhot at. One ſort perfectly hateth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they fear her, as long as ſhe holds up her head, they muſt lowr, fret and ſtorm, and never perfect their projects; yet they moſt malign and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie her, who by all humane
<pb facs="tcp:100221:4"/> and divine Laws ſhould live in obedience to her. No Church hath had more furious aſſaults made on her, but her enemies were ſtill repulſed: a Church of that firmneſs, that the Gates of Hell, even when Satan was let looſe, could not prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her. This is her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, all the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of any good figure give her the right hand of Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and of preeminence too. The very attempt then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend this Church is both He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical and Chriſtian, how weak ſoever the Undertaker be, he may have and hath a good heart, though his hands be feeble. It is true, <hi>Non eget au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xilio tali, nec defenſoribus iſtis;</hi> yet if a Puny manage a Cauſe under diſpute with good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb facs="tcp:100221:5"/> againſt an old experienced famous Lawyer pleading on the other ſide, he himſelf gains a little eſteem, but its great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to the Cauſe; That Cauſe was good which ſo mean a man could defend. This is my caſe, who am ſufficiently ſenſible of mine own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but very hearty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that Church whereof I have been a Prieſt for full for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eight years, ordained by one of your Lordſhip's Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours; for this I have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and do yet ſuffer in ſome ſort; (ſufferers may have leave to ſpeak) this I will defend, when I can doe no otherwiſe, by Pen, while I am able, yet always and no otherwiſe but <hi>permiſſu Superiorum,</hi> upon which account I tender this addreſs,

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THEY who underſtand what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation means, need not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves for a ſolution to that captious ſilly demand of the Papiſts, <hi>Where was your Church before Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> for to reform is but to amend what is amiſs, to correct and rectifie what is faulty, the ſame numerical ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſtill exiſting. Reformation is like the renovation of a ſinner, <hi>Eph. 4. 22, 23, 24.</hi> Saul the Perſecutour was the ſame man in kind with Paul the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour. The Prodigal, who took his journey into a far Countrey, was the ſame individual perſon who returned to his Father's Houſe a penitent. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Reformation is ſometimes neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet at all times dangerous, men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apt to run violently from one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme to another, jumping over the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den mean; therefore that it be warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb facs="tcp:100221:7"/> it ought to be duly circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated by juſt methods and meaſures, which by the good providence of God, and, I think, direction and guidance of his Holy Spirit, hit on the right way, obſerving all requiſites for the happy management of that great work, when ſhe reformed her ſelf. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It was done by juſt and lawfull Authority, the King and Clergy of the Kingdom concurring, as our late excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent King obſerved, ſaying, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to make it clearly appear, that this Church did never ſubmit, nor was ſubordinate to the two Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and that it was onely the King and Clergy who made the Reformation, the Parliament merely ſerving to help to give the civil Sanction. <hi>His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Second Paper to Mr.</hi> Alex. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon, <hi>Part 1. fol. 165.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They had good grounds to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the work; for that there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Reformation the Teſtimony of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Sixth, and Cardinal <hi>Pool, de Conc. p. 86.</hi> will aſſure; beſides, it was the deſire or pretence of all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
<pb facs="tcp:100221:7"/> in the Weſtern diviſion of the Church; eſpecially by the Emperours of <hi>Germany</hi> and Principalities therein.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That they proceeded with due mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is declared, <hi>Can. 30.</hi> For we profeſs, as they did, our Separation was not from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> but its Errours; our Church is the ſame it was before, onely differing as a garden wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the ſame unweeded, as the body purged from the ſame unpurged. What they did was to ſeparate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious from the vile, the droſs from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, metal. The Church was then like <hi>Jeremy's</hi> Baskets of Figs, <hi>Jer. 24.</hi> there were good, very good Figs in one, in the other the Figs were evil, very evil; ſo in the Church there was on one ſide good, very good things, in another part evil, very evil things; and our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers as they caſt out the evil, ſo they were very carefull to retain the good.</p>
            <p>What can we think then of our deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Diſſenters, who deſpiſe theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions and ſpeak evil of theſe Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who have undertaken this work with courage, and perfected it with a happy
<pb facs="tcp:100221:8"/> ſucceſs, even to the envy and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chriſtian world? Certainly there hath not in any age, in any part of the world, in that ſpace of time, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſuch a race of Kings as our five Reformed Princes, for all manly, Kingly and Chriſtian accompliſhments; neither hath there been a more Clergy-like Clergy than hath been under their Reigns. We can eſteem them to be no other than ſuch as S. <hi>Paul, Tit. 3. 10.</hi> notifies to be men ſubverted, that's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, utterly perverted in underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and will, whom the Governour of the Church is to reject, excommunicate him after two admonitions, which if they work no good effect, he is to reject with a ſevere cenſure, take no pains to diſpute with them any more, hearken no more to their Replies and Objections (faith <hi>Diod.</hi> they have by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy and non-ſubmiſſion to their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours put themſelves into an helpleſs and hopeleſs condition, they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated themſelves without the Sentence of a Judge (ſaith Dr. <hi>Ham</hi>) there is no hopes of them, and ſo leave them to the judgment of heaven, as hath been accuſtomed.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:100221:8"/>
            <p>What ſhall we ſay of half Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, conforming Non-conformiſts, who when they take the fit can come to Church, and attend there by outward Conformity? This will not clear them from the guilt of Schiſm, <hi>bonum eſt ex integra cauſa,</hi> and it's to be feared there is hypocriſie in the caſe; outward conformity may cheat the Law and mock men, but it cannot be an holy, living, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſacrifice to God; becauſe the good works of Faith muſt be done with a good and honeſt heart, in ſincerity and truth, out of a pure heart, and of a good conſcience, and of faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned, <hi>1 Tim. 1.</hi> and every duty muſt be done with reſpect to God's Commandment.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>But do you ſee them come to Church?</head>
               <p>Thanks to the King who will have Laws put in execution; but when they come, they come as Countrey-men do to Fairs and Markets, ſome ſooner, ſome later; and with the ſame reverence that they enter their Inn, ſome not at the beginning, or not till Sermon begin,
<pb facs="tcp:100221:9"/> ſome go out in an hurly burly after the Sermon is ended; this is contrary to the Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity, ſo that this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Church is neither Chriſtian nor Legal.</p>
               <p>Tea, but many come early, neither loll nor lubber, nor hang down their heads like a bulruſh, as too many do, but hold out to the laſt, and demean themſelves, unleſs ſometimes through inadvertency, as the Law requireth.</p>
               <p>This is confeſſed, but for all that it will not denominate them true Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them diſpute, ſcruple, deny and undervalue the Authority of the Church, rebell againſt its Governours, Aſſociate, pack Juries in a deſign to ruine the Church, and, as opportunity ſerves, take to a Conventicle, hold correſpondence with its profeſſed enemies, familiarly converſe with the excommunicated by the Church, and now and then commend them for their piety: nay, we are ſure ſeveral of theſe late Conſpiratours and Aſſociatours were ſuch as theſe, all which acted directly contrary to the
<pb facs="tcp:100221:9"/> Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church, and ſhall theſe paſs for true Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, who are but counterfeits? do not the groſſeſt Fanaticks reproach and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid us with them, when they tell us tauntingly, Take up your Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> men? you often declaim againſt us as Traitours and Rebels, but who are ſuch now? Were not moſt of the Conſpiratours ſuch as obſerved and kept the Church? They did ſo, in part, but we diſown them, becauſe we look upon them as the moſt dangerous enemies to the Crown and the Church; being moſt falſe to both by their juggling preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to them both.

To attempt a ſecond Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation will be a great reproach to our firſt Reformers, who confeſſedly were men of great learning, piety and zeal. For if they failed in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking either through ignorance, oſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy or intereſt, it will be readily
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100221:13"/> concluded they deſigned onely a Change, and endeavoured an innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which at once blaſts their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and juſtifies all the imputations of their Romiſh Adverſaries, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached them of novelty and Schiſm; And if we ſet upon a new refined Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, as their former charge will hardly be evaded, ſo with difficulty will we ſolve their latter Objections, <hi>viz.</hi> Proteſtants have no Principles, or, which is as bad, are ſo given to change they will not ſtand to their principles; whereas if we maintain the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be onely a Reduction of affairs to the primitive Apoſtolical and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick order and ſtate, we do not onely thereby render a ſecond Reformation unpracticable, but alſo invalidate all the Romiſh contumelies and calumnies. This was the avowed profeſſion of our firſt Reformers, they would onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve the Primitive Chriſtianity, and ſettle this Church according to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Pattern, concluding all other methods of Reformation to be irrational and ſchiſmatical. Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> in his famous Apology, <hi>p.</hi> 176, 177. fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares it, <hi>Acceſſimus quantum potuimus,</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100221:13"/> aſſerting the whole and every main part to be Apoſtolical and conſonant to the judgment and practice of the ancient Catholick Biſhops and Fathers. This Apology not onely <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> in his Epiſtle prefixed to it, but alſo the learned Divines of <hi>Tigur, Bullinger, Gualther, Wolphius,</hi> &amp;c. have ſo highly approved, that they reſolved, no Book extant in the Proteſtant cauſe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to it. Other eminent Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marine Divines might be mentioned, yea a Jeſuit in his Pamphlet againſt Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> hath confeſſed, that of all other courſes in the Reformation that which the Engliſh followed was the moſt effectual for the eſtabliſhment of our Religion againſt the Romiſh Church.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100221:14"/> ſecond Reformation diſſonant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from is in effect to renounce the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Primitive Catholick Church; with which all ſucceſſive Churches ought to hold (as near as poſſibly they can) a perfect correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and where this cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by reaſon of ſome croſs circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to reflect upon it as an infeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. The reaſon hereof is obvious; for the primitive and ſucceſſive Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are but one Body, having the ſame dependencies upon, and relation to the one Lord, one Faith and one Baptiſm; and the Catholick viſible Church and every regularly conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted particular Church is an organized Body, having ſeveral Members for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Offices, all which conſpire for unity, that there be no Schiſm in the Body, which certainly would happen, if ſucceſſive Churches obſerve not the ſame Laws and retain not the ſame Government, which the primitive maintained: For that which maketh the Church one, is the unity of theſe; and that which diſtinguiſheth one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or Society from another is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Laws and Government, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100221:14"/> ſo long as the ſame Laws and the ſame Government are in force, the Body is ſtill the ſame. Now as Jeſus Chriſt is the ſame, yeſterday, and to day, and for ever, ſo is his Church, which at firſt was embodied into an indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Society. For the Scripture aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us the Church is a Body, and that Body whereof Chriſt is the Head, <hi>Col. 1. 18, 24. Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 15, 16. which we profeſs to be Catholick, not onely in reſpect of perſons and place, but alſo of time; The Catholiciſm whereof not onely includeth variety of places, and multitudes of men, but is to be extended to univerſality of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. Now evident it is, that all Bodies Corporate, whether aggregate (ſuch as the Church is) or ſole, by their ſucceſſion are immortal as long as they retain the ſame fundamental Laws, and remain under the firſt ſettled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. If therefore we condeſcend to a new Reformation diſtinct from the firſt Settlement or oppoſite thereto, we deſign a ſchiſmatical ſeparation from the primitive Catholick Church, if we put it in execution we fall under the ſame condemnation we ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100221:15"/> the Romaniſts; this being the common Proteſtant Apology, We have departed from <hi>Rome</hi> no farther, than ſhe hath from the ancient Church and her ſelf; and if there were no other reaſon for this our ſeceſſion (as there is, <hi>viz.</hi> That we embraced Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before S. <hi>Peter</hi> planted a Church there, and when the Weſtern apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſet out by the Fathers, this of ours had the honour of being one of the Seven Dioceſan or Patriarchal Churches, as well as <hi>Rome</hi>) yet even this would juſtifie our Separation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was our duty, to reunite our ſelves to the Catholick Church, all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Churches being but, <hi>partes ſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lares,</hi> homogeneal parts of the whole. Whereupon it followeth that that Church which keeps cloſeſt to the primitive Catholick Pattern, and holds the neareſt alliance with it, is the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and that ſeveral Churches having ſuch a relation to, and dependence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, neither particular perſons, nor particular Churches, are to act as divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Bodies by themſelves (which is the ground of all Schiſm) but are to teach, and to be taught, and to doe all other
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100221:15"/> Chriſtian duties as parts conjoyned to the whole, and as Members of the ſame indeterminable Society.</p>

Suppoſe we ſhould yield to another project of Reformation, the iſſue will be confuſion and deſolation; for if we may conclude their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from their former practices and preſent principles, the deſign is to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-rule or aboliſh all, their way was to ſtrike at all, root and branch; and now they are for removing the Laws. Their courſe of regulation is to raſe the Walls of the City if they can, if not to undermine them. Down with the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the Popiſh Plot, and the direct way to this, is to divide it: All the Papiſt Pot Cannons and Sophiſms could never batter or ſhake our <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> till ſome of the Citizens thereof made breaches in it; Nay the Romaniſts never made an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon it, till the Puritans had made an aſſault, theſe gave the other both the opportunity and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to attack it. Tuſh (ſay the Popelings) let us levell this, the Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome Sectaries will either fall in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100221:16"/> ruines of it, or elſe into our hands; they have been very ſerviceable Tools to us in all our attempts, and no doubt will be ſo on to the end, if ever we ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, and then we know how to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage their tender Conſciences, let it but appear to them (which we will not fail to doe) they can gain by the barter, they (forſooth) have a new light, a new diſpenſation of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and they muſt wait on Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and follow that light.</p>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. What will the conſequence of this work be, if it go on? Is it to remove what is eſtabliſhed before we reſolve where to fix? This were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly mad work to demoliſh old Struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures before we have adviſed of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of the new. Perhaps a model is fanſied, but are all the Diſſenters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed about it? When they had power too much, and time too long to reſolve on a ſettled way, even then they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would or could unite, nor ever will or can. This we are ſure of, none of the ſchiſmatical Parties can have their own ends, unleſs all be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, which croſſeth their humours or
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100221:16"/> intereſts; and if this be done by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or by Law, not one of ten ſhall have his own ends, which becauſe they cannot obtain, their feuds will be high till one party get the full maſtery, and then the Plot of Union is marred. But who ſhall be taken into this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have the benefit of it? If all, nothing can follow but confuſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy, and ſcandal beyond an Apology; If one onely Party (which yet is unknown what it is) then the others if they dare will ſtand out and oppoſe it; if not, they will murmur and repine, and thus expoſtulate; Why ſhould they be ſecluded Members de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred of the privilege of Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? This (ſay they) we can ſay for our ſelves, we were drawn into the Lines of Communication by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions and ſolicitations of their grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Partizans and Comrades, and though they ſay it, have as much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted the good Old Cauſe. In this indeed we are all agreed, we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enjoy Liberty of Conſcience till we have power to kill and take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, neither likely to have Free Trade till, without any reſpect to Law,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100221:17"/> we can plunder and ſequeſter Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and ſhall we who are fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded with them be laid aſide? If it be pretended the favoured will give good ſecurity for their good behaviour for the future, (whereof there is yet no evidence) we are as free as they, not doubting to affirm, we are the more ſober and peaceable, in whom there is a more ſweet and gratious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of love and zeal, and have been more conſtant to their principles than they; For we can prove many of them were active Conformiſts, ſoon after proved perſecuting Presbyterians, then dough-baked Independents, and now again have tacked about, and are Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logueing Compliers. However, if ſome be received into favour and others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, there is plain partiality in the caſe, if all muſt be entertained, a downright unaccountable Schiſm fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. But to wave the Perſons to be comprehended, what Things muſt be granted them for an Union? If onely a few (unſatisfactory) alterations be tendered, the project is baffled; we ſhould be as far from Unity as now we are, for then the clamour would
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100221:17"/> be, our burthens are a little mitigated but not removed, our grievances are abated, but not fully ſatisfied, we muſt not leave an hoof behind us when we go out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> If many and great alterations be ſubmitted to, then they triumph in their Conqueſts; they had not onely Providence on their ſide but reaſon alſo and argument; and then we ſhall hear of nothing in Pulpits, Clubbs and Coffee-houſes but ſtories of their mighty Acts, that their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are now under great convictions, that they are the Godly conſcientious, Gods ſecret Ones, and the good Old Cauſe muſt needs be God's Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Having premiſed theſe Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, let us next reflect upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on which this motion of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt proceed, and firſt of that which is moſt oppoſed, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

Church Government is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for theſe reaſons; The Church is a Society which cannot ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: It is a Body whoſe parts are compacted, each whereof hath its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Office and Service, it is that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whereof Chriſt is the Head, who therefore will provide for its preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and peace, by placing Governours over it, which <hi>de facto</hi> he hath done,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100221:18"/> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. It is the Houſe of God whereof Chriſt is the Lord; who hath reſerved this prerogative to himſelf, to nominate and conſtitute the Stewards of his Houſhold and Family, as he did, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 42. hence thoſe commiſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him are called the Miniſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of the Myſteries of God. Therefore for any to exerciſe a power in his Houſe who is not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by him, or to reject thoſe powers which he hath entruſted to provide for his Family and rule his Houſe, is a moſt ſacrilegious invaſion and preſumption. This Houſe is his Kingdom too, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13. 24, 31, 33, &amp; 34. Temporal Monarchs, if they have occaſions to abſent themſelves from their Dominions, will always depute and ſubſtitute ſuch as ſhall take care for the preſervation of their Kingdoms in peace and tranquillity; certainly we have lower thoughts of Chriſt than we have of an earthly Potentate, if we can conceive that he having deſigned and formed a Kingdom of Heaven here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, would at his departure hence be ſo careleſs and inſenſible of its after ſtate and condition, that he would not

Heb. 13. 17. viz.</hi> I have actually conferred the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and dignity upon you, (not left my Kingdom at random to be ordered by contingent and infinitely variable votings, not to be new modelled 1536. when Jeſuitiſm and Presbyterianiſm firſt peeped out, nor to be reformed to confuſion in 1641. nor to receive
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100221:19"/> amendments in 1648. and a refinement in 1680.) and made a full grant to you and your Succeſſours for ever: what was then demiſed ſtands ſtill in full force and virtue, even the more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and ſober of the Sectaries will ſubſcribe to this, there ought to be a Government in the Church, that it continue not as a City without Walls, or a Vineyard without a Hedge, and many of them have ſtood ſtifly for the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of the ſeveral oppoſite and contradictory Models.</p>

If once we admit ſeveral contradiſtinguiſhed Governments we muſt grant ſeveral Heads and ſeveral Bodies. It can never be proved from Scripture God will approve ſeveral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments in his Church, or that he hath permitted any degrees or orders
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100221:20"/> of men to alter that which was from the beginning. This is one of the great crimes we charge upon the Pope, that he hath altered the Government of the Church, which will appear to be unjuſt if the Government thereof be ambulatory and <hi>ad placitum.</hi> Article what we can againſt him on this ſcore, if there be no one perpetual determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Government, he will eaſily abate the impeachment; for he will clear himſelf by this, that he being a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Prince, as well as an Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prelate, hath power upon reaſons of State and Diſcipline to alter the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Church, if God hath not fixed a conſtant unvariable Form; For if it be arbitrary and precarious, why ſhould any Kingdom or State deny that power to him which they aſſume and uſurp themſelves? In a well-ordered Kingdom, he is not onely a Traitour who diſclaims the <hi>jus Regnandi</hi> of his natural Liege Lord and Prince, but he alſo, who, without any authority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from him, or contrary to his pleaſure, ſhall preſume to exerciſe any of his Regalities, or powers annexed to and inherent in the Crown; ſo they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100221:20"/> who will readily grant Chriſt to be Head of the Church, yet withall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a power to form another Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than that which he obſerved, and ordered in his Church, are formal Schiſmaticks, and Traitours to Chriſt the King of Kings. This is obvious if we reject the authority of the Church, we renounce Chriſt's authority, and if we levell and caſhier the Catholick Government, we ſchiſmatically divide and ſo far ſeparate from the Catholick Church; which receives that denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation not onely in reſpect of that Faith, which is univerſally profeſſed, but alſo of the Government, which hath been and is univerſally obſerved. It is true there are many particular Churches in the Catholick, which are diſtinct locally and in a foreign ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but really and morally are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, becauſe they all and each of them adhere to the one Lord, one Faith and one Baptiſm, and retain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace. For this diſtinction is not in eſſentials, or integrating requiſites, but onely happens to them upon an extrinſecal and adventitious account, inaſmuch as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100221:21"/> it doth not ſpring from any diverſity or contrariety in Faith, Sacraments or Government, but doth onely accrue to them from the diverſity of ſeveral Kingdoms, independent one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, into which theſe are incorporated. It is true there was ſome diſtinction of Churches before the Kingdoms of the earth were Chriſtian, yet this aroſe upon an accidental reſpect from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Plantations. There is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Tradition which is probable, that every Apoſtle had his peculiar circuit appointed by Chriſt, whereupon they, ſome ſooner ſome later, diſperſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Twelve ſeveral Regions and parts in the world to fix their Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: if this be admitted, they were neceſſitated to ſuit their Rules and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce ſuch Cuſtoms as were moſt proper for the inhabitants and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of their ſeveral Aſſignments; this then will afford a probable reaſon of that variation of Orders and Cuſtoms in the Jewiſh and Gentile Plantations, who were of different tempers and principles, whom the Apoſtles would endeavour to pleaſe, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 19. 20. Now
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100221:21"/> though hereupon ſeveral circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial obſervations were taken up in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places and Provinces; yet ſtill the ſame Faith and the ſame Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the main was maintained. The Concluſion then is, all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt, Primitive or Succeſſive, have but one Lord, one Head, one King, are but all one Body, one Houſe, one Kingdom; therefore they all, <hi>de jure,</hi> are under one Government, which what it is, is next to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. That one neceſſary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is Epiſcopacy or Prelacy, which becauſe it hath prevailed in the Catholick Church ever ſince the firſt plantation of Chriſtianity, is therefore undoubtedly Apoſtolical, and if ſo, then certainly Divine. To demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate this, the method will be to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Evidences in order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Num.</hi> 1. Prelacy was founded ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally in the perſon of Chriſt, as the true Meſſiah; It was foretold, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. the Government ſhould be on his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and this to be perpetual, <hi>v.</hi> 7. and this he founded in an imparity of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100221:22"/> Eccleſiaſtical Officers, ſettling two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Orders for Church Miniſteries, the twelve Apoſtles and the ſeventy Diſciples, which were not empty Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, but had diſtinct Offices, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer not onely inveſted with dignities above the other, but with power over them; as appears by the Election of <hi>Matthias.</hi> Now Chriſt was entruſted with the Keys, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. 22. and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Sceptre, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 6. God committing the Government to him as the great Shepherd and Biſhop of our Souls, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 25. having the Key of <hi>David,</hi> Rev. 3. 7. This he ordered by an immutable Law, which neither could expire or be repealed. For all power was given to him both in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 18. a power not onely to protect but to rule the Church, not onely to rule the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of its Members, but externally to order and adminiſter it, as a publick Society, a power to rule in himſelf, or by Proxy and Delegates, therefore it follows in the exhibition thereof, that charge, <hi>Go ye,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 19. without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murr or diſpute; For I have the power to commiſſion you, and do command
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100221:22"/> you to execute it; I have received it from my Father thus to exerciſe that power, and empower you, and to it I was ſolemnly conſecrated by the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the Holy Ghoſt, as S. <hi>Luke</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 38. God anointed <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> with the Holy Ghoſt and with power, which at leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports thus much: As by the ceremony of anointing, God promoted perſons to high Dignities and Offices; ſo Chriſt was regularly advanced to his prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Function, to be the firſt and chief Biſhop in the Chriſtian Church, from whoſe fulneſs all others were to receive grace for grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Num.</hi> 2. Chriſt having performed this Office in perſon, took care that after his Aſcenſion into Heaven, the holy Apoſtles ſhould ſucceed him, whom he ſeparated for this Office, and over and above authoriſed them to depute and ſubſtitute others to keep the ſucceſſion of Rulers. This he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned and paſſed over to them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 29. I appoint you a Kingdom, as my Father hath appointed me; Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly at the octaves of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100221:23"/> he both confirmed them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 21. As my Father hath ſent me, even ſo I ſend you, and alſo conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them by that ſolemn Form ever ſince obſerved in the Catholick Church either in terms or words equivalent, (<hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>) This fully conſerred on them the habitual power which actually they were not licenſed to exerciſe till (as he was) they were authorized by the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, and endued with power, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 49. which happened ſoon after his Aſcenſion, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. when he took off this ſuſpenſion, and at <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> ſent the promiſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon them, the Comforter, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 26. the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 8. And ſo they were baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire which ſate upon each of them, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 3. that every of them might be a reſpective Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary in the Adminiſtration of his Kingdom. This ſitting of the Fire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on each of them as it deſtroyeth the Eraſtian Suppoſition (for the Apoſtles were neither Civilians nor common Lawyers, or Stateſmen) ſo it prejudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth both the Papal and Presbyterian
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100221:23"/> pretenſions. The Papal, becauſe it ſate not upon one, (S. <hi>Peter</hi>) which might have entitled him to a Juriſdiction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the reſt, but upon each of them, that what power one of them had, all and each of them had. For before, Chriſt had warranted to them twelve Thrones, for every Apoſtle one, <hi>Matt.</hi> 19. 28. as <hi>Camero</hi> hath obſerved, that every one might enjoy the ſame entire authority and ſupremacy. The Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian, becauſe it ſate not upon all as fellow Collegues or Common-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-men, but as ſo many ſingle Perſons, not that they could not, or did not for a time act jointly, but that it ſate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all and every of them; ſo that the power was granted to them jointly and ſeverally, whereupon when they took their circuits to their ſeveral a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, they ſeverally exerciſed their Function and Office. <hi>Bullinger</hi>'s conjecture is, We have no Canonical Records of the Government of the Church but in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> where the Platform is deſcribed and exemplified in the perſon of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> from whoſe example and practice we are to conclude how the reſt of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100221:24"/> Apoſtles firſt planted and then gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Church, Bul. <hi>part. 2. Epit. Tempor. &amp; rerum Tab. 6. de Apoſtal. &amp;c.</hi> But evident it is S. <hi>Paul</hi> acted as a ſingle perſon without any dependence upon all or any of the Twelve. Therefore (if this obſervation hold) all the reſt planted and governed ſeverally; if this fail, the ſtate and condition of their employment will enforce it: For if they depended, after the College was broken up, upon any one or the whole Community, they could not effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally have executed their Commiſſion, becauſe upon every exigent, eſpecially when they removed from one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to another, they muſt have had the conſent of that one, or the whole to licenſe and authorize them, which was utterly impoſſible to obtain. For they then being diſperſed into ſeveral Regions of great diſtance one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, they muſt give up their work till at every occaſion they had received orders, whether to undertake and how to manage it. Very few or none of them knew where to find S. <hi>Peter,</hi> if they did, they had no Poſt-office to tranſmit and return expreſſes; and the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100221:24"/> College after it was diſſolved, never aſſembled again. Impoſſible therefore it was for them to execute their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion validly under thoſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, unleſs each of them had been a Plenipotentiary by the tenour thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Num.</hi> 3. As Chriſt inveſted the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles with this power in a due ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to himſelf, ſo they in virtue of his inveſtiture were to conſtitute others to ſucceed them in the principals there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Confeſſedly the Apoſtolical Office was to reſide in the Church for ever. So <hi>J. O. Independ. Catech. p.</hi> 119. and the ordained by them were of the ſame Order with them; ſo <hi>Wàlo, p. 43, 44, &amp;</hi> 144. upon which account the title of Apoſtles was allowed in Scripture to many of thoſe whom the Apoſtles had ſeparated for the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaks faintly to the point on 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 9. Tales interdum vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat Apoſtolos, malo tamen, &amp;c.</hi> yet at laſt he comes off more frankly, telling us plainly who thoſe (<hi>us Apoſtles laſt</hi>) were, <hi>Qui in ordinem Apoſtolicum poſt Chriſti Reſurrectionem aſciti fuerunt.</hi> As <hi>Apollo Sylvanus Piſc. &amp;c.</hi> is very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100221:25"/> S. <hi>Paul</hi> gave them this title, <hi>Eo quod eodem munere fungerentur.</hi> Saint <hi>James</hi> was ordained Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> by the Apoſtles in the nineteenth of <hi>Tiberius</hi> (ſaith <hi>Blondel</hi> in <hi>Chron. p.</hi> 43.) the next year after Chriſt's Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion by his account, which, in his cenſure of the Pontifical Epiſtles, he affirms from all antiquity: and <hi>Walo, p.</hi> 20. aſſures us he was none of the Twelve, yet he is called an Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 19. which <hi>Blondel, Apol. pro ſent. Hier. p.</hi> 50. thus confirms; Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> the Apoſtle was a Biſhop, and Saint <hi>James</hi> the Biſhop was called an Apoſtle, the Apoſtles as Governours over their Plantations were called Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; and Biſhops with reſpect to the miniſterial Miſſion were called Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> (ſaith <hi>Walo, p.</hi> 44.) were ſtyled Apoſtles, but in very truth were Biſhops by the ſame right, and of the ſame order, that thoſe are of this day, who govern the Church, and have authority over Presbyters. This he undertakes to prove, <hi>p.</hi> 62. Biſhops hold the chief degree in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Order, as heretofore they did who were called Apoſtles, but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100221:25"/> and the Presbyter-Biſhops were of a diſtinct Order, as he labours to aſſert from <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 6. 22, 23. in theſe words, <hi>Tunc dicebatur in Conciliis ex utroque ordine compoſitis, &amp;c.</hi> Then it was ſaid of the Council moulded up of both Orders, that of the Apoſtles, and that of the Presbyters, <hi>id. p.</hi> 269. This he ſeconds with an obſervation from the Greek Interpreters, <hi>p.</hi> 26, 27. who concluded the Apoſtles were of an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er dignity than the Presbyters, fairly reſolving with them they were ſeveral Orders, <hi>p.</hi> 269. and that Ordination could not be common to both, <hi>p.</hi> 229. Caſt all this together, <hi>viz.</hi> The Order of the Apoſtles was of higher digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than that of Presbyters, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles then were in truth Biſhops, theſe Biſhops had command over the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, they were diſtinct Orders, all this in the Age of the Apoſtles, and that Ordination could not be common to both, the reſult will be, there was then a diſparity in Church Officers; the identity of Name will not conclude an identity in Office; Presbyters were under the Juriſdiction of Biſhops, to them, and them onely Ordination ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100221:26"/> which is to aſſert from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Dioceſan Biſhops in the Prelatiſts ſenſe. <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> acknowledge there is a Subordination of many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to one Preſident by Divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, <hi>hoc fert natura, &amp;c.</hi> This we have from nature, the diſpoſition of men requires it. So <hi>Cal. l. 4. Inſt. c. 6. ſect.</hi> 8. It was, it is, and ever will be neceſſary, <hi>ex Ordinatione Dei per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petua,</hi> by the perpetual Ordinance of God there be one Preſident. So <hi>Beza, defen. p.</hi> 153. But hath this Preſident any power? yea a double power, firſt, <hi>regendae communis actionis jus,</hi> to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the common action, ſummon Presbyters, appoint time and place, and propoſe matters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſecond is by authority to execute what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by common conſent, <hi>Cal. l. 4. Inſt. c. 4. ſect.</hi> 2. But is he not capable of a ſtanding power? yea, he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a farther latitude from the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Laws of men, who, without any violation of Divine Ordinance, may ſettle it on one man for his life; For either in the days of the Apoſtles or immediately after, the Epiſcopal Office became elective and perpetual to one
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100221:26"/> man. <hi>Quod certè reprehendi nec poteſt, nec debet,</hi> Bez. <hi>defenſ. p. 141. &amp; inde.</hi> But is not the application hereof mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humane? No, not wholly, <hi>huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, non ſimpliciter tamen ſed, &amp;c.</hi> I may call it humane, not ſimply but comparatively, without any injury to the Fathers, or ſo many Churches. In good time! The conſectary of this (if I miſtake not) is, to reject this Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiary-power, as ſuch, is repugnant to God's Ordinance, to reject it upon the form of application is an injury to the Fathers and many Churches; It is neceſſary from nature and the Divine Inſtitution, and the fixing of it in one perſon for life, to diſtinct acts and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, is Apoſtolical either in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Age, or immediately thereupon, and is Catholick ever ſince. Very right, for the conceit of a ſucceſſive annual Preſidency held by turns, is both novel, never any Church for 1500 years received it, and alſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, thoſe who after did, are ſo few, that 500 for one have oppoſed it. All antiquity hath avouched ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whoſe names are found in the Scriptures to have been Biſhops. Theſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100221:27"/> names following are in the Scripture, and Ancients of undoubted credit have averred them for Biſhops, as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>James,</hi> ſirnamed the <hi>Juſt,</hi> to have been Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> we have <hi>Blondel's</hi> Teſtimony for this from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.</p>

For why ſhould they be particularly taxed for ſcandals and irregularities therein if they had no power to reform and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy them? It ſeems too ſevere to charge neglects on them, who have no power to take cognizance of crimes and to correct them. That thoſe Aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches were fixed and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, diſtinct Churches, the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians cannot deny, who affirm they were governed by Presbyters; for that muſt needs be a determinate Body which is governed by one or by many.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100221:29"/> is frivolous; for there might, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch there were, yet theſe might be and were under one Preſident over them in Chief; for ſuch as theſe many are to be found in our Cities where there are Biſhops to rule them, and it is evident that thoſe Prefects were and did exerciſe authority over both Laity and Clergy, from the rule given to <hi>Timothy</hi> by S. <hi>Paul</hi> before alledged. <hi>John Frigivile</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> writ his <hi>Reform.

In the Apoſtles times, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly immediately after, there were three Orders in the Church, not as <hi>Calvin</hi> (who firſt conjured up Lay-Elders to be his officious Agitatours) recites them, nor as Mr. <hi>Dallee</hi> conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but as they are accounted in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons. Indeed it is very likely there was firſt but one Order, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical or Epiſcopal, the Apoſtles or Biſhops, diſcharging all Church Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration and Offices. But they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a power entire in themſelves and radically, they were enabled to derive and communicate what they thought fit for the neceſſities of the Church to others: Accordingly the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, as it is recorded in the <hi>Acts,</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:100221:31"/> the Order of Deacons was inſtituted, who were not empowered onely to collect, receive and diſtribute Alms to the neceſſities of the poor, but to high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Eccleſiaſtical Offices. For we find <hi>Philip</hi> both preached and baptized. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 35, 38. That this <hi>Philip</hi> was not the Apoſtle, but the Deacon; <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> thinketh ſo, becauſe he ſuppoſeth the Apoſtles were not then removed from <hi>Jeruſalem; Gualter</hi> is poſitive from the Teſtimony of <hi>Epiph. de Sim. &amp;c.</hi> and all ancient Writers.

Biſhops alone Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, as <hi>Arcud. de Concord. l. 6. c. 4. ſect. Igitur,</hi> obſerves. Indeed in the Latin Church Presbyters did lay on hands with the Biſhop at the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Presbyter, yet this was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, not for its validity, but for its ſolemnity and atteſtation.

For if the Apoſtles did ſettle Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in their ſeveral Plantations, and theſe ſuch as the Prelatiſts plead for, then that is the one neceſſary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be retained in the Church. For the Apoſtles being inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, they did then act and order the Church according to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. <hi>Ameſius</hi> himſelf reſolves, what is Apoſtolical Stands by Divine Right, his words are, <hi>Med.

This he delivers to aſſert the Divine Authority and unalterableneſs of the Lord's day, and will therefore hold here. For if Epiſcopacy ſtand in the Church by the ſame authority that the Lord's day doth, which Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> hath fully proved, then it hath the ſame Divine Authority for its Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment. This King <hi>James</hi> ſaw, and ſo, <hi>Premonition, p.</hi> 44. is very poſitive, That Biſhops ought to be in the Church I always maintained as an Apoſtolical Order, and ſo the Ordinance of God. The Diſſenters, who allow of Church Government as ſuch, have often decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what concerns the rule of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Church by Officers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Chriſt is unchangeable. Now that the Biſhops are thoſe Officers hath been evidenced from Scripture Rules and Precedents, and confirmed by the ſuffrage of a cloud of Witneſſes, who as they accord in their Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, ſo were faithfull unto death; ſome whereof were the choſen Witneſſes of Chriſt's Reſurrection; ſome were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100221:35"/> Succeſſours to thoſe ordained by the Apoſtles; others of the higheſt reputation in the Church, for teſtifiers of Catholick Tradition; all of them had, and ſtill have ſuch credit in the Chriſtian world, that their atteſtation hath ever ſince been reverenced and accepted in momentous matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſuch as the religious obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lord's day, the number and integrity of the Canonical Books of holy Scripture, the Baptiſm of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Epiſcopacy at leaſt ſtands upon the ſame grounds with theſe, if theſe upon the true meaſures of Piety and Religion be not alterable, neither is it. The moſt learned of the Diſſenters have been forced to uſe the ſame proofs for theſe which we do for Epiſcopacy, when they have not done ſo, they have been baffled in a good cauſe, as hereafter may be exemplified. The Concluſion then is, to attempt a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Epiſcopacy by its extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is contrary to the ſure and ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Rules of Chriſtianity.</p>

               <p>SECT. 1. They who to the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution or abolition of Epiſcopacy, have or would ſet up new models of Church Government, are either the Eraſtians, the Presbyterians, the Independents or the Pontificians. The three former were hatched ſince <hi>an.</hi> 1510. the laſt was long of hammering, but was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver rightly caſt till <hi>Julius</hi> the Second moulded it at <hi>Lateran,</hi> and of a crackt piece made it whole. Now every of theſe will prefer Epiſcopacy, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> before any of the other Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms but their own eſpouſed Darling, which they would have all to accept, becauſe complying with and favouring their wordly deſigns and intereſts. But ask ſeriouſly any of the more obſerving
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100221:36"/> and underſtanding men, which of the Claimers they would rather incline to, provided they could not poſſibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their own to bear the ſway, they will fairly take to Epiſcopacy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Num.</hi> 1. The Eraſtians will by no means joyn with the Pontificians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they challenge and uſurp a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to take cognizance in cauſes merely Civil, <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia:</hi> Not with the Presbyterians, becauſe they alſo claim the ſame, <hi>ſub formalitate Scandali,</hi> both of them maintain the power both of make and confirm Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Laws as originally and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically in their ſupreme Judicatures; the Civil Magiſtrate is onely to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them, which he muſt doe upon their <hi>Significavit's</hi> and Writs of Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition at his peril, otherwiſe he ſhall be clogged with their Sentences of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. Nor do they much fanſie the Independents, becauſe they will not endure the Civil Magiſtrate to interpoſe in Church matters, nor have the leaſt ſtroke in externals of Religion. As for the Biſhops, though it be a grievance that they ſometimes
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100221:36"/> meddle in matters of a mixt nature, yet becauſe they know, that what they act in theſe caſes is by authority deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Civil Magiſtrate, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the known ſtanding Laws, they eſteem Epiſcopacy as the moſt ſafe and expedient form; and ſo Biſhops may ſtand for the preſent, till they can by rebellion graſp again all Civil and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical power in their clutches.</p>

Independents utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like both Eraſtians and Pontificians, and though they can aſſociate with the Presbyterians at preſent, yet they hold no good opinion of them. In a Book entituled, <hi>Saint John Baptiſt,</hi> they heavily declaim againſt them, ſaying, They had eſtabliſhed a <hi>Dagon</hi> in Chriſt's Throne, had ſtinted the whole wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at laſt it came to this, they had rather the French King, yea the Great Turk ſhould rule over them. In a Book called, <hi>The Arraignment of Perſecution,</hi> they declared, If ever the Presbyterians rule in chief, an higher perſecuting ſpirit would be found in them than they had felt from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: <hi>J.

The Books are commonly to be had, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they oft and ſadly complained, all that they could expect for their expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Bloud and Treaſure (none of their own) was to be recompenſed with greater grievances, and more dangerous licentiouſneſs (which is too true) than they ever mourned for (which is very falſe, for moſt of them were colloguing compliers) under the Government of King and Biſhops.

But let it be for once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, that each of thoſe Models had ſomewhat good, yet withall recollect that the Conſtitution of this Church is of ſo excellent a mixture with the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt ingredients, that it will effect thoſe great ends ſo much pretended by them more ſtrongly and obligingly, if it may attain its juſt value and reſpect.

So far good, if they were not poſſeſſed, or rather pretend onely to be, with fears and jealouſies, that this Church appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome principle to the diminution of the Civil Power, which what it is none can with any colour of reaſon conjecture, unleſs this be it, that whilſt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100221:38"/> ſhe fully renders to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſar's;</hi> ſhe is ſtill cautious to reſerve to God the things that are God's. <hi>Eraſtus</hi> the firſt Founder of that Order had no prejudice againſt any thing determined in this Church upon that ſcore, if we reſpect either the motives which induced him to quarrel the Allobrogian Model, or the Arguments he framed againſt it.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Motives were,</head>
                  <p n="1">1. He had obſerved that <hi>Calvin</hi> had ſo cunningly contrived it, that he and his aſſiſting Miniſters could upon every occaſion overtop the Stateſmen. The artifice lay herein, he took for a blind onely ſix Miniſters, but twelve Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicks, yet ſo that the Miniſters were to continue for life, but the Stateſmen to be annually choſen, whereby he conceived theſe changling Officers would be ſo wary as not to croſs the ſtanding Moderatours, which ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, as he himſelf ſignified in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to <hi>Bulling. Semper fuimus in iſt a promiſcua colluvie ſuperiores, We had always the better in that rifraff Junto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:100221:38"/>2. He knew thoſe choſen Officers had neither age, or experience, nor judgment, nor manners (a full deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the late Lay-Elders) to enable them to ſuſtain ſo great an employment with credit and honour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He was provoked, that a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content Engliſh fugitive had liberty to diſcuſs this Theſis, <hi>viz.</hi> That in every well-ordered Church this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was to be retained, in which the Miniſters with the concurrence of the Elderſhips ſhould have the power of excommunicating all offenders, even Princes themſelves: Hereupon in a juſt indignation he expreſſed his abhorrence of this bold ſeditious Propoſition, yet with great indiſcretion he cauſeleſly vented his wrath againſt Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as it was a Church Diſcipline.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>His Arguments improved by his Followers are theſe,</head>
                  <p>He ſuppoſed Excommunication did totally cut off the excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the internal and inviſible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church; whereupon his Followers argued. If the power of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100221:39"/> be in the Church Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, then it lies in their power to ſave or damn men. But his ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is falſe, and the inference of his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers is wild, as one (and the moſt learned) of them hath obſerved; for, he ſaith, <hi>finis hujuſmodi diſciplinae, &amp;c.</hi> The end of this diſcipline (not final Sentence) was (is ſo ſtill) that the cenſured being deprived of the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al privileges of the Church, they might be humbled to ſalvation. This is the whole truth and nothing but the truth, for its onely a barr from the external viſible Society of Believers, not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude men from heaven, but to encline them to put themſelves in a capacity to be received again into the peace of the Church, for the enjoyment of thoſe great privileges of holy commerce, which all men religiouſly affected ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire and value. A method of Diſcipline which Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles thought proper to reduce and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim ſinners. It is medicinal in Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s expreſſion, <hi>To. 9. Serm. de Poeniten. med.</hi> (if that Tract be his) ordained and applied for edification, not deſtruction; if for deſtruction, it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100221:39"/> is for that of the Fleſh, that the Spirit might be ſaved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15. or its a Chaſtiſement, the cenſured are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by chaſtiſed of the Lord that they ſhould not be condemned with the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 32. which Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not ſweet or joyous for the preſent, but grievous, yet yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteouſneſs to them that are exerciſed thereby, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11.</p>
                  <p>2. Excommunication (ſay they) is a cenſure inferring a civil Penalty, therefore if the Church makes uſe of it, ſhe enlargeth her Phylacteries by an encroachment on the civil Power.</p>
                  <p>But where do thoſe wrathfull Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectours find this? or how can they prove it?</p>
                  <p>It was always reckoned in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of ſpiritual gifts, practiſed by the Church for ſpiritual ends and uſes, and exerciſed upon the members of the Church, <hi>qua tales,</hi> in that capacity one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; if, upon contempt hereof, a civil Penalty was incurred, this proceeded not from the quality and nature of the cenſure, but from the authority of the civil Magiſtrate, who ſo far reſpected
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100221:40"/> the Church, that he made proviſions againſt the contempt of her Diſcipline. That which the Church aims at, is either to reduce the offender, or to warn others, or to diſcharge her duty in diſcountenancing and diſowning dangerous prevailing Hereſies, Schiſms and Scandals; all which are of ſpiritual concernment and cognizance.</p>
                  <p>3. The Biſhops claim this power by Divine Right, and why not? Forſooth, this is contrary to the Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, and ſets up two Supremes in one Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>This is an high Charge: I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded if the great Turk was acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this noble Argument, he would in a rage deſtroy all the poor Chriſtian Biſhops in his Empire, or elſe he would ſcorn and deride it, as it juſtly deſerveth. For the Argument runs thus, Miniſters by a Divine Right challenge a power to baptize Proſelytes, communicate Chriſtians, and doe other offices belonging to their Functions, Therefore they ſet up two Supremes in one Kingdom: or thus, The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture declareth, the Holy Ghoſt made them Overſeers to feed the Church of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100221:40"/> God (ſure they may pretend to Divine Right who derive their title from the Holy Ghoſt) Therefore the Scripture contradicteth that Supremacy which it eſtabliſheth. But in ſober ſadneſs! did none of the firſt Chriſtian Emperours, or after Kings underſtand their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Prerogative? did they ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Imperial and Epiſcopal power were incompatible? were they all ſo blind they could not eſpie this ſo obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an inconſiſtency? or did any of our own great Councils before that of 40. ever make ſuch a determination? As for our own Kingdom, we may without diſparagement to their great wiſedoms, compare many of our Kings with the ableſt of any or all of them; King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth was a wiſe Prince, one that would not bate an Ace of his Sovereignty, yet he never ſcrupled at the Divine Right of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy. Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was as jealous of her Prerogative, and as zealous for it, as the higheſt and moſt maſculine Spirit, yet ſhe reverenced and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Order. The greateſt for Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Judgment the Father and the Son were as Prelatical as the Prelatiſts.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100221:41"/> What King <hi>James</hi> his opinion was of Epiſcopacy is before related, what it was concerning his Supremacy, which he cogently aſſerted, he thus expreſſed, <hi>Premonition, p.</hi> 108. It conſiſts not in making Articles of Faith, but in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding obedience be given to the word of God, in reforming Religion according to his preſcribed will, in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the ſpiritual Power (this is to be noted) with the temporal Sword, in procuring due obedience to the Church (mark this too) in judging and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off all frivolous Queſtions and Schiſms, as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did; and finally in making a <hi>decorum</hi> to be obſerved in all things, and eſtabliſhing Order in all indifferent things. King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt of bleſſed memory hath above and beyond all others reſolved the caſe, in his anſwer to <hi>Henderſon</hi>'s Papers, in his Reply to the Anſwer of the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> Divines, <hi>Rel.</hi> Car. <hi>fol.</hi> 691. and in his final Anſwer, <hi>fol.</hi> 709. Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> in his large Hiſtory of Titles, <hi>p.</hi> 157. thus ſtated it. God hath committed the Tabernacle to <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi,</hi> as well as the Kingdom to <hi>Judah,</hi> and though <hi>Judah</hi> hath power over
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100221:41"/> 
                     <hi>Levi,</hi> as touching the outward Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, even of the Temple it ſelf, yet <hi>Judah</hi> meddled not with the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and the holy Miniſtery, but recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the will of God from the mouth of the Prieſt. This is evident; God, for the promoting of Piety and Juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, hath ordained two diſtinct Powers, the Regal and the Sacerdotal, which, in the times of the Patriarchs, were formally united, and inſeparably followed the firſt born of the male kind in every Family. This he ſeemed to alter in the perſons of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> inveſting <hi>Moſes</hi> the younger Brother with the Regality, <hi>Aaron</hi> the elder in the Prieſthood, both theſe received their Commiſſions from God, <hi>Num.</hi> 16. Every power is the Ordinance of God, but the Regal as Supreme, the Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotal as Subordinate, which ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is not eſſential or cauſal, but moral, by virtue of God's Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and accidental for Order's ſake. Certainly God, who gives all power, can order a ſubordination of powers derived from him, the one to be ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, the other inferiour; and God was pleaſed to diſpoſe the diſtribution
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100221:42"/> of thoſe under the Moſaical diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that as the Prieſts were not to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp the Regal, (for <hi>Abimelech</hi> was Servant to <hi>Saul, 1 Sam.</hi> 22. 12. and <hi>David</hi> was Lord to <hi>Nathan, 1 Reg.</hi> 1. 24.) ſo neither were the Kings to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Sacerdotal Function, but were bound to conſult their Prieſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as <hi>Joſhua</hi> was <hi>Eleazer, Num.</hi> 27. 21. by God's appointment, and <hi>David,</hi> did <hi>Abiathar, 1 Sam.</hi> 23. 6. We are ſure <hi>Saul, Jeroboam, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ziah</hi> were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely checked for exerciſing ſuch Acts as formerly belonged to the Prieſts, not that they were debarred from regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and providing for the due diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the Prieſtly Offices: for that is a part of their duty, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2. and <hi>Ariſt. l. 1. Ethic. c.</hi> 13. was herein Orthodox, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but they are to permit the Prieſts the exerciſes of their Functions, and in matters of Religion to require the Law at their mouths, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 7. which all Chriſtian Kings have always granted. Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> owneth, that after the Aſcenſion of our Lord, the power Eccleſiaſtical was in Apoſtles, after them in ſuch as they
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100221:42"/> had ordained, and ſo delivered down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to others ordained by them, and the great Eraſtian name hath yielded them a power to decide caſes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and to declare what is lawfull, what not; This was reſpectively done, but he fell far ſhort of the mark; for certainly to baptize Proſelytes is a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger portion of power than bare inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting or teaching the Law, even a power to admit Members into the Chriſtian Society, and in all reaſon, they who have power to admit, have power occaſionally to exclude, hence that Gentleman was forced to confeſs, they had power to bind and looſe, which in Scripture ſignifies to forbid and decree, which is more than any Caſuiſt or Preacher as ſuch pretends to, and is rather proper to a Legiſlative or Judicial Power, which was ſometimes exerciſed by the Church, as when the Apoſtles upon a complaint, where no leſs men than S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were Advocates for the Plaintiffs, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an obligatory Decree, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 28. &amp; 16. 4. That Precept or Permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (<hi>Tell the Church</hi>) at leaſt implies the Church had then power to take
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100221:43"/> cognizance of treſpaſſes, and to ſay the civil Magiſtrate is that Church is ridiculous: for then the ſenſe would be, Tell the treſpaſs to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> three hundred years after it was committed, for till then there was no certainly known Chriſtian Emperour, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were not by the Diſcipline of the Church to ſeek for remedy at heathen Tribunals in the firſt inſtance. Now as there was a ſubordination of theſe Powers, ſo there was a diſtinction; the one was the power of the Sword, committed to the civil Magiſtrate, to reward well-doers, and to puniſh evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers, of all kinds, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, a Schiſmatick, an Idolater, or Blaſphemer, as well as a Thief, a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, or a Traitor; and this hath its immediate effect upon the outward man, body and goods, with reference to the concerns of this life, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 7. 26. the other is the power of the Keys, to labour in word and Doctrine, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort and rebuke with all authority, to rule well in ſpiritual concerns, to bind and to looſe, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 17. Tit. 1. 5. Matt.</hi> 16. 19. the proper operation whereof is upon the Soul with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100221:43"/> to the world to come. There is a difference, ſaith the above cited <hi>Joh. Frig. Refor. Pol.</hi> between Dominion and Juriſdiction; neither the Apoſtles, nor chief Biſhops exerciſed Dominion, but their Offices, having Juriſdiction, <hi>p.</hi> 16. as in <hi>France</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>p.</hi> 17.) the King hath the civil Dominion, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Juriſdiction, ſo in <hi>England</hi> the Queen hath the Dominion, but the Biſhops the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction; hence <hi>Ariſt. l. 10. Ethic. c. 9. n.</hi> 10. reſolves, Legiſlatours are differenced from Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of Faculties, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Profeſſours are to Act, Legiſlatours to preſcribe rules for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. The King's power is the ſupreme, that of Prieſts ſubordinate, which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference proceeds not from the natural excellency of the one power above the other, but from the all-wiſe diſpoſition of God, who is the chief power em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powring, as he is ſaid to be, <hi>natura na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turans.</hi> The Biſhops with their ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Miniſters are the Executours of Chriſt's laſt Will and Teſtament, the King is the Superviſor, and the Judge too, to grant them Letters of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. Biſhops and Prieſts are the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100221:44"/> Miniſters of Religion, Kings are the Rulers of it and them.</p>
                  <p>The ſubſtance of the whole is, the true Sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are the ſole Aſſertors of the King's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, not onely in expreſſions and complement, but in fact and real ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, not upon reaſons of State, or dictates of Prudence, but the rule of Conſcience, which none of the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters therefrom will allow. Not the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſtians, for they play at faſt and looſe with the King's Supremacy, and by diſtinctions and limitations fix it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no where but make it as vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as their fortunes. One of the moſt eſteemed Partizans made this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation thereof, The King is the ſupreme Governour, but not the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power. Gallant Law Sophiſtry, as if it were poſſible he could govern in chief, who had not a power ſutable thereto: The Independents plead an exemption from it: The Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans utterly deny it: Such a Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as the Kings claimed, and the two Houſes of Parliament (Eraſtian-wiſe) craved (indeed at firſt they did but
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100221:44"/> beg it, which after they plundred) I diſclaim (ſaid <hi>Henderſon</hi> ſecond Paper <hi>num. 7.) The true Nonconformiſt</hi> makes it the main work of his Book to charge it with Antichriſtianiſm. The Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficians perfectly abhor it; The Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts are the onely defenders of it. The Pontificians make Kings their Churches Miniſters, and Presbyterians make them their Kirk Miniſters, not the Miniſters of God; The Eraſtians and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are agreed they are originally the People's Miniſters not God's. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiſts aſſent with the Law of Chriſt, and the Laws of the Kingdom, the King is God's Miniſter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. The Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians and Independents reſolve, the Kingdom is in and under the Church, and then the Government of that muſt be conformed to that of this. If then the Presbyterians be rampant, the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government muſt be Ariſtocratical. If the Independents be the maſters of Miſrule, it muſt be Democratical; but if it happen the Eraſtians be the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, then the Game is King and no King; at the beſt he is but their Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtee, he muſt ſtand on his good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and paſs his accounts to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100221:45"/> for the contracting good People. If the Pope be the great Cham, the civil Government muſt truckle.</p>
                  <p>SECT. 3. To bring the matter nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer home, there was a time when the blades of Fortune in 40 thought it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to declare they had no intentions for any alterations; It was when the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Army had ſcented and followed the Scent very hotly, and when the King had objected the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns amongſt them, they formed a Declaration to renounce all ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, <hi>Aug.</hi> 9. 42. as before they had proteſted againſt it, as a ſlander, and for once ſuch an one as the Father of lies had invented, <hi>Remonſt.</hi> Dec. 41. This was ſmartly urged againſt them by <hi>E.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100221:45"/> in Doctrine or Worſhip as a capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal offence. But for all their ſolemn proteſtations to the contrary, the Root and Branch deſign went on, and when it was firſt ſet on foot, Petitions were preſented to prevent and ſtifle it. The total of Subſcribers in onely ſeven Counties, and thoſe none of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, amounted to 482 Lords and Knights, 1740 Eſquires and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, 44559 Freeholders, and 631 Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; number enough to ſhew how generally well affected the people of beſt rank and quality were for this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but their reaſons are rather to be weighed, which were theſe, by drawing them methodically.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They deſire they may left in that ſtate the Apoſtles ſettled and left in the Church, in that the three Ages of Martyrs were governed by, in that the thirteen Ages ſince have always gloried in, proving themſelves by their ſucceſſion of Biſhops, members of the Catholick Church.

For we ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and believe the ſudden mutation of a Government, ſo long ſettled, and ſo well known, cannot with any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable utility recompence the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances and diſorders which it may work by novelty, therefore we cannot without trembling and perplexity of mind entertain a thought of a change, and of innovation in a matter of ſo high concernment. For if the deſign go on, we ſhall be reduced to ſuch a deſperate condition, that we ſhall not know how to ſettle our ſelves, or form our obedience in ſuch diſtractions, and ſometimes repugnancies of commands, as will unavoidably enſue.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) What they then felt in part, ſince this Government is traduced and deſpiſed, the Houſes of God are profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Miniſters of Chriſt contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Liturgy depraved, that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute model the Lord's Prayer vilified, the Sacraments in ſome places unduly adminiſtred, in others profanely neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, Marriages illegally ſolemnized,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100221:47"/> Burials uncharitably performed, and the very fundamentals of our Religion by the publication of a new Creed, teaching the abrogation of the moral Law, (All the Religion we can hope for muſt be a movable Creed, repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable by privileges, and to be made ſuitable to the deſigns of any prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Faction) whereby God is provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, his ſacred Majeſty diſhonoured, the Conſciences of the people diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Miniſtery diſheartned, and the Enemies of the Church emboldned in their enterprizes.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We cannot hearken to ſuch a change, becauſe for many years we have found the comfort and benefit of Epiſcopacy, which as it hath been emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſerviceable to this Kingdom, ſo it is moſt compliable with the civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment (into the Fabrick whereof it is incorporate) that we muſt conclude it as the moſt pious, ſo the moſt ſafe and prudent. Wherefore to call it a Vaſſalage and intolerable burthen, and thereupon to endeavour its removal, reliſheth not of piety, prudence, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice or charity. This we are the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther induced to preſent, both becauſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100221:48"/> our Fathers have told us of the great convenience and moderation of this Government, and we have felt the comfortable experience thereof. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is this Kingdom is much indeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Biſhops for their piety, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, zeal and ſufferings, which we truſt ſhall never be forgotten. Thus far they.</p>
                  <p>It may not be amiſs to ſubjoyn the later opinion of a great name with the Eraſtians, who once indeed had declared before, he was no ſuch fool as to be a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan, yet it is well known how, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but at laſt was forced to expreſs his great eſteem of Catholick Order. The words are reported, <hi>Fair Warning, Part. 2. p.</hi> 4. and thus are ſet out, It is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull thing, that, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, he gives his opinion, I ſhould much fear that our moſt excellent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſo miſerably confounded by its diſtracted followers, would one day give place to the two grand miſchiefs of the world Popery and Profaneneſs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which there are no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies beſides the mercifull aſſiſtence of heaven, than ſound Doctrine ſettled, ſevere Diſcipline eſtabliſhed, a decent
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100221:48"/> and holy Worſhip ſecured, and a grand eſtabliſhment enjoyned, which may fence in truth and virtue, and keep out errour and ſin, whereby the Orthodox good part of the Nation may be known and encouraged, as the Heterodox may be diſcovered and awed.</p>
                  <p>SECT. 4. The little good which can be expected from Presbyterianiſm and Independency is, that the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of the one Sect pretend great zeal againſt Ignorance and Sin, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is aggrieved at promiſcuous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions, though both of them, by their barkings and bawlings againſt this Church, and the Diſcipline and Government thereof, have and do ſtill obſtruct the methods which ſhe hath provided as remedies againſt thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies. Now that thoſe Offices which ſhe hath determined for thoſe ends, are proper and very inſtrumental, through the aſſiſtence of the Divine grace, which accompanies and inanimates them to devoutly affected Chriſtians, moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual thereto, they will be neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to acknowledge, by obſerving the Order preſcribed, which lies thus.</p>

                  <p>Every Infant is to be ſolemnly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triculated into the Church by holy Baptiſm, theſe baptized in a competent time are to be catechiſed in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtian Religion, and then to be confirmed by the Biſhop, and are required to give attention to the reading and preaching of the word of God. Being thus prepared, they are admittable to the great myſtery of the holy Euchariſt, and for neglect of theſe means the offenders are liable to the cenſures of the Church. That theſe methods are Scriptural, and Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal moſt of the Diſſenters acknowledge; ſome of them indeed ſcruple at Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but <hi>Calvin</hi> conceives it to be originally Apoſtolical, with whom more than a whole Jury of reformed Divines have given in their Verdict.

                  <p>In this I blame the Presbyterians and Independents, becauſe at preſent they hang together by the tails, but for all the fair copies of their Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, if their wiſhed and laboured for turn come, their faces will look ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways. If the Presbyterians get the ſtart, and keep their ground for a while, they will ſoon proclaim the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents to be Babylonians; If the Independents once more out-wit the Presbyterians, and turn them out of power and truſt, then the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents will face about, and tell them roundly they are Egyptians.</p>
                  <p>SECT. 5. As for the Papiſts, the beſt they can brag on is their unity, of which they rant highly, that they, and they onely have found out the true way to it: this is a mere bravado to which a wiſe and learned perſon made heretofore this return (<hi>viz.</hi>) Let me ſee the Jeſuits and Seculars recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled in <hi>England,</hi> a Dominican and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit in Doctrinal Papiſtry, French and Italians in ſtate Papiſtry, then I ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100221:50"/> them a little to vapour: their oral and conclave Traditioniſts are hard at it in their confutations of each other, their great heads of Unity Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> and <hi>Clemens</hi> fell very foul one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: they cannot agree about the Supremacy of a Pope and a Council, nor which of their four or five Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches is the infallible one: the Popes and Councils have declared ſeveral ways upon the points, which obviates their common ſhift, <hi>viz.</hi> Their claſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and bickerings are but in ſchola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick opinions and niceties; for then the definitions of Popes and Councils are no matters of Faith. But here again they quarrel; for ſome aſſert a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is heretical by its repugnancy to what is revealed by Chriſt: others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm a Doctrine is heretical becauſe the Church hath declared ſo: its the former ſort thus confutes. If the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine be heretical from the Churches declaration, then the Church hath power to make Articles of Faith: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which alſo there is a great buſtle among them; for ſome of them pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily deny the Church hath any power to make Articles of Faith: but
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100221:50"/> moſt of the Canoniſts, and all the Popes Exchequer men affirm it; ſo ſchiſmatically are they divided about their Church, the Head thereof, with the terms and objects of their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Unity: when theſe are ſmartly objected to them their onely <hi>ſalvo</hi> is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Their Rule would be a means to hold them in unity if it were followed. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good! for the plain Engliſh of this is, their Rule about which they ſo ſmartly wrangle, and concerning which they could never yet agree, will or may be a means of unity when they are agreed about it. In oppoſition whereto we aſſert the Rule which we propoſe is not flexible like theirs, but infallible, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſure word of God duly applied; for the application whereof we take in the conſentient judgment of the univerſal Church in matters of Faith; and in points of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the conſtant uſage thereof: theſe we ſtand to, becauſe, if they be not the true means of unity, the true Church of God, which always relied on theſe, and no other, had never any. If to this ſome Romaniſts give aſſent, as ſome of them do, they are
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100221:51"/> ſo far Engliſh Epiſcopal Proteſtants. From all which premiſed there is great reaſon and good warranty to conclude, that under the Government of King and Biſhops the Civil Power is moſt ſafely fixed; mixt Communion, Ignorance and Sin are moſt effectually provided againſt; Unity and Obedience ſtorngly guarded; therefore whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good or deſirable can be expected from Eraſtianiſm, Presbyterianiſm, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency, or Popery, is really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented in Epiſcopacy; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this in true polity ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and ſupported: the other modes are not to be admitted or entertained; not the Eraſtians, for they play at faſt and looſe with Kings and the Church; they reſpect no Government preſent, to which their ſubmiſſion is compliance, not obedience. Not the Presbyterians, for they encroach upon and vilifie Kingly authority; if they find a King, they will if they dare ſhackle him, or in our Northern ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion houghband him. Not the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents, for with them Kings are the Peoples Creatures and Truſtees, neither will they permit him with their good
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100221:51"/> wills to intermeddle in Church Affairs. Not the Pontificians, for reaſons given by the learned Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> and that honourable Perſon who ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him. It is therefore the clear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Crown, if it would have a Church National to govern by, it ought to be Proteſtant Epiſcopal, as a late ingenious Writer hath obſerved, leſt if it be held of the Pope, Kirk, or People <hi>in Capite,</hi> it totter and fall. That Probleme which Dr. <hi>Prideaux Ep. Ded. ad faſc. Contro. An ſuprematus Papalis ſit potiùs Antichriſtianus quàm Presbyterianus aut Enthuſiaſticus?</hi> may hence eaſily be reſolved if we be not too palpably partial, we muſt declare them all, or none at all to be Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or Antichriſtian. The beſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ever yet produced to prove the Pope to be Antichriſt is his bold chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge over all Kings and Monarchs, to depoſe them and diſpoſe of their Crowns and Dignities; which if it be good, it will hold as ſtrongly againſt all other Sectaries, for they are as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Limbs of Antichriſt who preach and preſs Rebellion againſt their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Sovereign, and thoſe commiſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100221:52"/> by him, upon a Puritan Vote, or Republican Reſolution, as they who prove and proſecute it upon the Pope's <hi>Placet</hi> or <hi>Fiat:</hi> that cannot be the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Godlineſs and Saintſhip in a Presbyterian or Independent, which is preſumed to be the myſtery of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Pope; and if the Doctrine of Rebellion be the mark of the Beaſt in a Pontifician, it cannot be a ſign of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection in a Smectymnuan or Oweniſt: for if the Pope by the plenitude of his power can diſcharge Subjects from the Oath and bonds of Allegiance, then the Sectaries by what names or titles ſoever divided or ſubdivided can free themſelves upon eaſier terms: for one will abſolve himſelf by a dormant diſpenſation of the ſpirit; another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelf by the pretence of a new light; a third will plead Providence; a fourth Conſcience, and the Blades of Fortune will ſtand upon their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges.</p>
                  <p>The reſult of this tedious Chapter is, God had always a Church, this Church had always a Government, this was always detemined by God, who in the firſt Ages of the world ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100221:53"/> his Apoſtles, and under them the Seventy Diſciples. After his Aſcenſion, and deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ruled in chief, having Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants and Aſſiſtants to them, whom they after ſubſtituted, as the neceſſities of the Church required, for Biſhops, with Deacons and Prieſts under their Juriſdiction. Thus the Church ſtood and was governed for 300 years, till the nurſing Fathers appeared; then and ever ſince Kings and Biſhops have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in it, Kings having the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Biſhops the Juriſdiction in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church. This was one great end of the Reformation, to reſtore our Kings and Biſhops to their univerſally acknowledged Rights due to them by Divine Law; this of all other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is the moſt Chriſtian, rational and practicable, becauſe moſt ſuiting with the main end of Government, which is that we may live quiet and peaceable lives, without any Faction or Schiſm, in all godlineſs and honeſty; and this therefore and no other is to be retained in the Church, both upon the true meaſures of piety and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>

Eph. 4. 1 Cor.</hi> 12. enumerated the gifts of the Spirit he gave a full Catalogue thereof, then this pretended gift is begged, becauſe no ſuch is mentioned in that Company; that of praying by the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 15. was praying in an unknown Tongue, <hi>v.</hi> 14. which required an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter; however this be, thoſe gifts were not common to all Believers, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was any of them communicated to ſelect perſons for popularity and oſtentation, but for profit and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100221:56"/> yea, their proper purpoſe was to prevent that licentiouſneſs that was taken from the pretence thereof, and even to reſtrain arbitrary prayers, and to confine the gifted to ſuch ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as the holy Spirit dictated to them; this is evident, the Apoſtle cenſures ſome of the pretenders for claſhing one with another, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 21. it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard that the Spirit was given to any to pray upon their own heads, or according to their own luſts, intereſts and paſſions; but ſuppoſing there were ſuch a gift, yet it was not to be uſed at every meeting; for if an Interpreter were wanting at any ſuch meeting, then all they had to doe was either to reſort to the Common Prayers or to break up and be gone: neither laſtly was this gift given promiſcuouſly to all of all Sexes, it being pretended as a peculiar to the Miniſter, or ſome inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red perſon endowed therewith, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore praying here muſt be praying in the Church, <hi>v.</hi> 20. 22. by the Churches prayers according to the order and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome thereof, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40. and then the meaning is, Every man or woman meeting at the Church or obſerving
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100221:57"/> the cuſtomary conſtituted devotions ought to be thus habited and thus to demean themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By Propheſying here we are not to underſtand prediction of future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, nor the gift of interpreting what was ſpoken by the gift of Tongues, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. v.</hi> 2, 3. nor for ſpeaking to men for edification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 29. all are not Prophets; nor is it to be taken paſſively, as ſome imagine, for hearing a Prophecy, for then every one that hears a Prophecy is a Prophet; and by the ſame reaſon, every one that hears a Sermon is a Preacher; and a reaſon ought to be rendred why praying ſhould not be interpreted paſſively as well as propheſying, but the notion here is the ſame with that of, 1 <hi>Sam. 10. 5. 1 Chron. 25. 1. Luk.</hi> 1. 67. for ſinging Pſalms and Hymns, ſo the ſenſe is perſpicuous (<hi>viz.</hi>) Let every man and woman ſinging and praiſing God in the Church, appear in ſuch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits as are ſuitable to their Sex. This ſhould not ſeem odd to them who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all to ſing, but ſilence the whole Congregation in the act of Prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in ſuch ſinging the Pſalms which
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100221:57"/> are uſed contain in them prayers, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, interceſſions and thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings; but others are verily perſuaded that all both men and women have joynt intereſt in the publick Service of God with the officiating Miniſters, who as they are for order's ſake to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and lead the Congregation, ſo all aſſembled have their parts to act. A bare corporal preſence is mockery and dalliance, an Eye or Ear ſervice will never be accepted as the reaſonable ſervice of God. Thus it hath been from the beginning (which is our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's way of arguing, <hi>Matt.</hi> 19. 8.) ever ſince men called upon the name of the Lord; for thus it was practiſed in the Patriarchal ages, as our <hi>Greg.</hi> hath exemplified, <hi>p.</hi> 120, 121. Under the Law examples are numerous, <hi>Ex. 15. 1. 1 Chron.</hi> 15. 36. and 29. 20. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 29. the manner is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, <hi>Ez.</hi> 3. 10, 11. and the practice proved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 3. and 107. 8, 15, 21, 31.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100221:58"/> common both to Miniſter and People, who were to accompany him (as it is expreſſed in the introduction to our Liturgy) with an humble voice, <hi>Cum diſciplina &amp; modeſtis precibus,</hi> as Saint <hi>Cypr.

Yet for once let it be ſuppoſed, the People onely expreſſed <hi>Amen</hi> at the Miniſter's prayer, this could not be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally done to an extempore effuſion; becauſe they could not doe it with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, this they could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not acquainted with the Schediaſt's ſenſe, for whilſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is in labour rightly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what he means, no rational judgment can be paſſed till after ſome pauſe and deliberation upon what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, and whilſt its thus employed, the Schediaſt in his poſt haſte is ſo far gone, that either he cannot attend to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100221:59"/> what he next delivereth, or he is at a loſs of what he hath delivered, and then all that he can doe is either to fall to his ſtudy or take all upon an impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit Faith; which if he do, he muſt ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to contradictions, abſurdities and wickedneſs. This is one foul piece of Popery, to put all devotion on the Prieſt, for when 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. is urged againſt the Papiſts for their prayers in an unknown Tongue, the beſt anſwer that is given by their Controvertiſts and Commentatours is, <hi>Populus eſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeps omnium precum quas pro omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus fundit Sacerdos;</hi> for that the Prieſt ſpeaketh not to Men but to God, and the miniſterial Office would be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly invaded, if the people be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to utter any thing more than a bare <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>SECT. 4. We produce good reaſons, as well as good rules and great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, for ſet Forms.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An arbitrary form by a new ſet of words may perhaps affect and work ſtrangely upon the ſenſitive Soul, as the frantick feats of the Turkiſh Dervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes do on thoſe miſerable deluded peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; phraſes and variety of them with cadencies, affected tones and geſtures, wry mouths and twinkling eyes, with much ſweat and noiſe, may raiſe the humours and paſſions into diſorder, but they can never prevail with a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional conſidering man to gain his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, unleſs it be to pity them or ſmile at them. That which they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem as a gift is rather an art by the dilatation of the animal ſpirits, which
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100221:61"/> are much pleaſed and raiſed by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in novelty and variety, and oft puts the Soul into ſtrange heats and fancies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To borrow three from Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, Ep.</hi> 87.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A determinate Form from which Miniſters are not to vary in their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, is uſefull as an help to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome; he might have ſaid of the many, yea the moſt, if not all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a Teſtimony of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches conſent and unity; he might have added of her conformity with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a way to ſtop the deſultori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous levity of thoſe who are for new things; Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will help him here, who in his <hi>Diſp. of Lit. Prop.</hi> 10. in his great experience, acknowledgeth, the conſtant diſuſe of ſet Forms is apt to breed a giddineſs in Religion, and it may make men Hypocrites, who ſhall delude themſelves with fancies, that they delight in God, when it is but in thoſe novelties and varieties of expreſſion. Indeed extempore prayers are ſtrong deluſions in ſeveral reſpects, For,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:100221:61"/>1. The moſt prudent and cunning ſort of the pretenders to this faculty uſe ſtudy and premeditation, which they conceive neceſſary to pray ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, yet here lies the cheat, they would have their herd to take their compoſed Forms as iſſues of their ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den conceptions. A great man of the Faction freely imparted his mind here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to a Friend, ſaying, He had ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Forms lying by him, moſt of which being committed to memory, by the interchangeable uſe of them, he was thought by the people always to pray without premeditation, <hi>Engl. Reprover, p.</hi> 153. This is juſt <hi>ſi vuli populus decipi decipiatur,</hi> a Puritan <hi>pia fraus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Zealots of the Sect honour an honeſt unpremeditated prayer with the title of Spiritual, by way of propriety, in oppoſition to ſet Forms for ordinary uſe, pretending the Spirit immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuggeſts the expreſſions. Thus <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> in his experiences publiſhed with Licence from <hi>Herle</hi> once Prolocutor of their Aſſembly, <hi>Angier, Johnſon</hi> and <hi>Waite,</hi> Provincials in the Claſs in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire</hi> upon a private Faſt obſerved, <hi>Jan.</hi> 6. 1642. held it forth, The Lord
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100221:62"/> gave ſome that exerciſed that day the very ſpirit and power of prayer, to the raviſhment of the hearers; ſurely it was the Spirit ſpake in them, which they reſolved from <hi>Zach. 12. 10. Rom.</hi> 8. 26. This is a Jeſuitical Cheat, as it is reported by <hi>Maffeus, elevante ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu, &amp;c.</hi> that the Spirit would raiſe <hi>Ignatius</hi> at his prayers four cubits from the earth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The great Sticklers for the good old Cauſe ſo highly extoll extempore conceptions, that they own them as the beſt evidences of their Party and Piety; firſt idolizing that which in ſome is mere natural, in others an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial habit of Enthuſiaſm, as <hi>Caſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> hath evidenced, <hi>c.</hi> 4. next, idoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing the perſons pretending to it, who have been very monſters of men; ſuch as <hi>Achitophel</hi> who (as the Rabbins re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late) prayed every day thrice, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very time had a conceived Oration; ſuch as <hi>Baſilides</hi> the great Duke of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and <hi>Oliver,</hi> two moſt bloudy Villains and Tyrants; ſuch as the bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemous <hi>Hacket</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> and the vile Wretch were in <hi>Scotland;</hi> the horrid execrable Regicides, and the

               <p>SECT. 5. It is confeſſed by the moſt knowing men of the Party, that impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſtated Forms were in common prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in the Fourth Century, which is an Argument they were ſo from the beginning. For the Fathers of that Age, being perſons eminent for piety and ſincerity in the Chriſtian profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would not innovate, and being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo men of excellent accompliſhments would eaſily have obſerved what was moſt proper for the diſcharge of their Function. Had they believed that low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie Fancy, that the modification of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip by perſonal abilities was the formal act of the miniſterial Office, as the cutting of Cloath into ſuch a ſhape by his own skill is the formal miniſtration of a Taylor, as an <hi>Anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, p.</hi> 79. of his <hi>Survey,</hi> mechanical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held forth; they doubtleſs would have made uſe of their great perſonal abilities in their publick adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which confeſſedly they did not, and it is certain they would not doe ſo, becauſe they conceived themſelves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100221:63"/> to retain the ancient Forms in veneration to thoſe pious perſons who compoſed and injoyned them for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick uſe. The Third Council at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, c.</hi> 3. reſolved, <hi>Quaſcunque, &amp;c.</hi> Whatſoever prayers any ſhall tranſcribe for themſelves, let them be taken out of a Copy before in uſe. S. <hi>Baſil. de Sp. Sanct. c.</hi> 27. refers to the ſolemn words of prayer obſerved before his time in the benediction at the Euchariſt. Saint <hi>Chryſ. Hom. 2. in 2. ad Cor.</hi> exemplifies a Form which had long before been conſtituted in the Church. In <hi>Ireland</hi> S. <hi>Patrick</hi> brought a Liturgy which he received from <hi>Germanus</hi> and <hi>Lupus,</hi> ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally taken from S. <hi>Mark.</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> in his Diſcourſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion profeſſed by the ancient Iriſh, affirmeth, he had ſeen it ſet down in an ancient Fragment well nigh nine hundred years ſince, remaining now in the Library of Sir <hi>Robert Cotton.</hi> That every exception againſt thoſe Liturgies of Saint <hi>James,</hi> &amp;c. that they were ſuppoſititious, is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſuch there had been; for if they were corrupted, ſomething was pure; if ſomewhat was ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious

               <p>One trifling objection againſt our Liturgy, which ſerves to amuſe the Vulgar, is not to be neglected. It is this, The firſt Reformers induſtriouſly contrived the Common Prayer Book, to endear the Papiſts to its uſe.</p>
               <p>This in the judgment of wiſe men is to commend them, <hi>Zanch. in Phil.</hi> 4. 8. thought the gratification of bad men in thoſe things wherein we do not offend God, to be a duty. <hi>Amyral. de Seceſſ. ab Eccl. Rom. p.</hi> 225. highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves this courſe, <hi>atque hic commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare, &amp;c.</hi> we are here to conſider with what wiſedom and moderation the French and Genevian Churches contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their publick Forms of Prayer. They are ſo far from handling any controverſial matters therein, that the Pontificians themſelves ſcruple not to uſe them; and, which is ſcarce to be believed, but that the matter of fact is notorious, they have picked out of them certain Prayers, which they have inſerted into their Manuals for the uſe of the people in their native Language. The objectors might have remembred,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100221:64"/> that Book took with the Romaniſts for full ten years of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign; probably had longer, but that their dear Friends the Puritans, had diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the peace of the Church, which gave the Pope an opportunity to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch his Emiſſaries, and ever ſince both Parties have bandied againſt it.</p>
               <p>The Conſectaries of the premiſſes are, ſtated Liturgy from Scripture, with the practice of the primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and continued in the Catholick Church, is the beſt ſervice of God; and our Liturgy being perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed thereto, is to be retained. It was then no vanity or preſumption in Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> to engage againſt all oppoſers thereof, if he was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to take <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> with three or four more for his aſſiſtants, he would prove there was nothing therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but what was agreeable with the holy Scriptures, and primitive An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> had great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to aſſert, <hi>Acceſſimus, &amp;c.</hi> We came as near as poſſibly we could to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der uſed in the Apoſtles times, <hi>Apol. par. 5. c. 15. diviſ.</hi> 8. and more fully, <hi>par. 6. c. 16. diviſ.</hi> 1.

The Platform drawer, c.</hi> 10, 11. 8. is peremptory, <hi>Nefas eſt, &amp;c.</hi> It is wickedneſs to oppoſe the judgment of Rulers, <hi>ſine ſufficienti &amp; ponderoſa cauſa;</hi> to explain which he declares, then it is a ſufficient and weighty cauſe, when at leaſt there is <hi>violenta praeſumptio</hi> a violent preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the judgment of truly wiſe men, that the Superiours have not ſwerved from the truth. But the Catechiſm maker, an old Trader in Subtilties, goes more cunningly to work: This is his artifice, <hi>p.</hi> 61, 62. Whatſoever is of circumſtance in the manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of religious Worſhip, not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of eſpecial determination, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merging or ariſing onely occaſionally upon the doing of what is appointed,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100221:65"/> at this or that time, in this or that place, or the like, is left to moral pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Now he immediately ſubjoyns, but the addition of Ceremonies, not neceſſarily belonging neither to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of Chriſt, nor unto thoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances whoſe diſpoſal falls under the rules of moral prudence, neither doth nor can add any thing to the due order of Goſpel Worſhip. This laſt Clauſe is but the opinion of a few muſhrome Sectaries, which is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by the judgment of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church and all wiſe men. It is remarkable, when the <hi>Aberdeen</hi> Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours proved from the Confeſſions of the Reformed Churches and judgment of ſome learned men, that more than bare circumſtances of actions were left to the determination of the Church, and plainly told them, their ſtirring about Ceremonies was a ſcandal to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reformed Churches, <hi>Demand.</hi> 13. The Three Apoſtles of the Covenant, <hi>Henderſon, Dickſon</hi> and <hi>Cant,</hi> fairly ſlipped by this in their firſt return, but being once more preſſed, they frankly confeſſed the charge, ſaying, We deny not but Divines both ancient
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100221:66"/> and modern, are againſt us concerning the lawfulneſs of the things controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>p.</hi> 22. all abſolutely either allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or judging them tolerable, <hi>p.</hi> 28. For we ſcarce know any without his Majeſty's Dominions that peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemn them as unlawfull: and at laſt were driven to this feeble ſlurr to uphold all their innovations and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious actions, <hi>viz.</hi> They had ſeen the day of the Lord's power in the Land. But if it be poſſible to be an <hi>Oedipus</hi> to this <hi>Sphinx,</hi> we are to watch the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and refuges of this Fox.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What doth he mean by his occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional emergents, either his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances be they, if ſo, then he muſt reconcile himſelf to his Brethren, who allow them to be natural or inſeparable accidents and adjuncts, not occaſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but conſtantly attending all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal actions; or elſe his occaſional e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergents, are ſome, <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> neceſſaries, that is, when occaſion is offered, for religious Worſhip, ſuch circumſtances and the like are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be adhibited: for the laſt clauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> But the ſuperaddition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being an exception to the foregoing it muſt
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100221:66"/> ſignifie this or nothing, <hi>viz.</hi> That Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies are not neceſſarily belonging, but circumſtances do neceſſarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For,</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſeems to diſtinguiſh theſe not onely in expreſſion, but putting them in a different letter. Let this be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that they are diſtinguiſhable, yet the diſtinction is onely modal; for when a circumſtance is actually appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any Act, then it falls under the notion of a Ceremony, that which is a circumſtance in the general ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted conſideration, becomes a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony by the particular uſage and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. Time, place, and the like, that is, habit and geſture, are cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, but this time or place, this or that habit and geſture, by the ſpecial determination of the indefinite adjuncts to obſervation are Ceremonies. But herein the Doctour kept a-loof from the conteſt, for the matter in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate is, firſt, Whether religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ought to be performed with ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and reverence? And if ſo, then Whether Ceremonies be not proper for its Solemnity?</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:100221:67"/>3. What the things and matters are which he coucheth under his [and the like] Was he afraid of an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which his Partiſans had ſo ſhrewdly clubbed? yet his [and the like] is as like an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as one Egg can be to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If habit and geſture fall under his [and the like] he muſt wear the Surplice and kneel when he is ordered, which becauſe they agree not with his chiverell Conſcience, he puts us off with an obſcure inſignificant [and the like.] But if he be reſerved, Brother <hi>Rutherforth</hi> coughs out, reckons ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and geſture with and among his ſix phyſical circumſtances; which if they be, then according to his rule, they fall under the rules of moral pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p n="4">4. How comes it to paſs that his circumſtances are not capable of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial determination? Certainly God could (if in his infinite wiſedom he had thought fit) have preſcribed the intire manner, (as once he did) as well as the duty; therefore time, place and the like, are capable of ſpecial deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, with the occaſional emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, <hi>viz.</hi> The monthly <hi>Wedneſday</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:100221:67"/> Faſt, and the annual Thankſgiving on the third of <hi>September:</hi> and he could have ordered who ſhould have carried on the work of the days, <hi>J. O.</hi> for one, and <hi>Smect.</hi> for the other end, and made them a Directory to order them how to preach and pray; he could have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the habit and geſture as well as place, S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s as well as <hi>Margaret</hi>'s <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> if then the circumſtances of time and place be, ſo the like form, habit and geſtures are left to moral prudence.</p>
               <p n="5">5. What is his moral prudence? Here we are in the dark, till the <hi>illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minato</hi> do in good earneſt declare, whether his prudence be a peculiar of ſome Set of gifted men, or the whole Set of ſecret Ones, or of ſome few De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magogues, who with their ſeditious Oratours, drive on their particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts by gratifying the luſts of their charmed herds, and have rare pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks for their Purſes and Conſciences. Or whether it be the publick and the Legal Governours of the Church, or the private prudence of every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Chriſtian; if the former, then what is pleaded, is obtained; if the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100221:68"/> latter, then why may not the publick judgment interpoſe in thoſe things, on which private diſcretion and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may reſolve? Doubtleſs particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, or ſuch as are arbitrarily aſſociated at the moſt, have onely a private capacity, and all wiſe men and good have heretofore been of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion; that publick perſons are moſt proper to be entruſted with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of publick concerns, both becauſe God hath committed it to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what a Chriſtian may ſafely doe upon the dictates of his Conſcience, he may warrantably doe when enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by publick authority. This they practiſe in a plain matter of fact, An Oath is generally confeſſed by them to be a part of religious worſhip; But publick authority hath preſcribed its form of adminiſtration, and appointed ſignificant Ceremonies at the taking thereof. Here I demand whether an Oath thus formed and circumſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted can be lawfully taken or no? If not, how comes it to paſs that theſe men, in any inſtance wherein their temporal intereſts are concerned, are
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100221:68"/> free to it? If they can, and doe, why may not the ſame authority determine the circumſtantials of the Second and Fourth Commandment as well as of the Third? Are they not equally Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Divine Worſhip? And why may not the ſame require our confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to their Conſtitutions in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts of religious Worſhip, as well as command and enforce ſubmiſſion to their Acts for the modifying, limiting and enlarging the duties of the Second Table? Is not holy Text as much a rule of perfection for the Offices of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Charity, as for religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? Is not Chriſt the Lawgiver to both? And can there be a fairer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the plenitude of his power, than that by Commiſſion he hath ſettled and delegated his Officers here on earth to make rules for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and honorary performance of what he hath indiſpenſably commanded? What therefore they by their Legan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine power duly executed do order, is ordered by him. <hi>Quod quis per a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium, &amp;c.</hi> he that heareth you, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth me.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:100221:69"/>
               <p>SECT. 2. Ceremonies thus ſtated are in ſome degree neceſſary (as we uſually call ornamentals in an Houſe neceſſaries) becauſe ſuch is the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of all external actions, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them they cannot be ſolemnly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, which in all religious affairs, as well as civil tranſactions, ought to be reſpected. All Societies have their ceremonial Obſervations as well as fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Conſtitutions, to which they have ſo great reſpect, that they ſuſpect theſe to be ſore ſhaken, when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are removed; and the Catholick Church hath ever thought Ceremonies ſo ſubſervient to the decent, regular and reverend performance of Chriſtian Inſtitutions, that without them the Service could not receive nor retain its due value and eſteem. In the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Community, Unity and Uniformity are commanded duties, and all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have hitherto believed Ceremonies are the beſt fences and ſecurities for them, and ſuch as add much luſtre and honour to exerciſes of Religion. How great a part of the judicial Law was Ceremonial? not onely by types and figures of good things to come, which
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100221:69"/> as carnal Ordinances were to expire when the fulneſs of time came, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants and attendants of thoſe good duties then enjoyned, which are not abrogated by Chriſt. That Text, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 17. reſpects not one diviſion of the Law, but every part, ſo that the whole remains in force to receive its perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Goſpel. The moral Law, though nulled in its preſumed ability to juſtification, which the grace of Jeſus Chriſt ſupplieth, yet liveth as a rule of obedience. The judicial ſtands ſtill in its full ſtrength in matters of common equity, though as to thoſe Laws which peculiarly reſpected the Jewiſh State its rigour is abated, to ſupply which God hath given to ſupreme Powers authority to enact ſuch Decrees as are conducible to the great ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Ceremonial, as it conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of weak and beggarly rudiments is determined, yet it holds as a directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Church for ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; For one great end thereof was to teach us to ſerve God regularly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently; <hi>Ameſius, Med. Theol. l. 2. c. 15. n.</hi> 16. confeſſes, Inſtitutions merely Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial do yet contain in them a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100221:70"/> equity, and do yet teach us that certain fitting days (therefore fitting Rites by parity of reaſon) be aſſigned for God's publick Worſhip, <hi>Subſtantia Legis Ceremonialis eſt perpetua, Zanch. de Relig. Obſerv. c. 15. Aphor. 4. J. Frig. p.</hi> 9. of his <hi>Ref. Pol.</hi> thus expreſſeth it in reference to the whole; There is no abrogation, well there may be ſome derogation; which he hath borrowed from the Canoniſts and Caſuiſts, who thus diſtinguiſh, <hi>Derogatur Legi cùm pars detrahitur; abrogatur cùm prorſus tollïtur, Barth. Fum. Tit. Abrog.</hi> and he thus explains it; A derogation doth but expound an Edict, as we ſee the Goſpel derogateth from the Law by taking away the Letter, and requiring it be taken after the Spirit, now the ſpirit of the Law is the equity thereof, but the letter is the rigour of the words. We have a Saying, the reaſon of the Law is its ſoul; and every ſenſe affixed contrary to the reaſon of its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting is unreaſonable. Now as in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Statutes of Repeal, ſome uſeleſs or prejudicial things are nulled, but what conduceth to good ends is by cautious <hi>proviſo</hi>'s ſtrengthened; ſo the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100221:70"/> Moſaical Law in thoſe things which were burthenſome and inconvenient, is quite out of all, but thoſe that are no way derogatory to the Diſcipline of Chriſt and his eaſie yoke, and which are very agreeable with the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtian Society, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity have their full virtue. It was the obſervation of <hi>Melancthon,</hi> that the fourth Commandment was <hi>Morale prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptum de Ceremoniali,</hi> which (if I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him aright) the ultimoſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Law is moral, but what is ſpecially commanded is Ceremonial, and if ſo, then plainly it is moral, that ſome things ſhould be Ceremonial: And becauſe Ceremonies have been by all almoſt adjudged ſerviceable to the common interchangeable good of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, therefore they are not to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med trivial or ſuperfluous; for nothing is ſo which is a concurring good mean to a good end, or hath a ſocial good end in good reſolutions.</p>
               <p>SECT. 3. If the quarrel be at their ſignificancy, certainly the more ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant they are, the more expedient al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they are, and the Church hath good
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100221:71"/> authority to expedients, for what is both lawfull and laudable is in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree neceſſary; and if S. <hi>Paul</hi> thought it incumbent on every ſingle Chriſtian, to provide things honeſt in the ſight of all men, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 8. then much more is the Church bound to take care in that reſpect for her ſelf and her members. Now theſe honeſt things which are to be provided are ſuch as in the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of all wiſe men, whether good or bad, are grave, venerable, attractive and obliging, and ſuch are our Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; which are experimented to be wholſome preſervatives of the golden mean betwixt nakedneſs and vanity, veneration and ſuperſtition, gaudineſs and rudeneſs, and therefore of the kind of thoſe honeſt things; But S. <hi>Paul</hi> is yet more particular, ſeeming to put ſignificant Ceremonies, <hi>ſub Praecepto, 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 8. I will therefore (I appoint it by Apoſtolical authority, ſaith <hi>Diod.</hi>) that men lift up holy hands, by this Ceremony (ſaith he) to expreſs the devotion of the heart; <hi>Piſc.</hi> ſeconds him, the lifting up the hands (ſays he) is a ſign of the elevation of the heart, with this <hi>proviſo,</hi> not that this geſture
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100221:71"/> is ſo neceſſary, that we are indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tyed to it; For we find the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can uſed it not, but ſmote upon his Breaſt, yet therein he was a true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt, who obſerved an uncomman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſignificant rite according to the then received cuſtome, if Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot</hi>'s warranty be good, that in Chriſt's time they prayed with their hands laid on their breaſts, the right hand being placed on the left, [Proſtration was no commanded Rite, yet approved, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 3.] All theſe had their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſignifications, that of lifting up the hands, an expreſſion both of our faith and confidence in God, and of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and ſincerity in our ſelves, thoſe of ſmiting the breaſt and proſtration, notes of humility and ſelf-denial, all of them, of reverence and ſubmiſſion of mind, and reſpectively practiſed firſt by the Jews and after by the ancient Chriſtians, <hi>Grot. in loc.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved what he taught, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 14. I bow my knees, not metaphorically, but phyſically, to teſtifie (as <hi>Diod.</hi> and <hi>Piſc.</hi>) his humility in prayer. The Non-conformiſts themſelves can, when the Fit takes them, uncover their heads,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100221:72"/> (which is no natural but topical uſage) at their prayers, ſinging and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating, which they either refer to ſome preſent ſenſible object, and then they are as idolatrous as they fanſie the Papiſts to be, or elſe they uſe it as an expreſſion of ſome moral duty, which is to obſerve a ſignificant Ceremony: All who have approved Ceremonies (and all have done ſo but this petty peddling Tribe) have the rather ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them for their ſignificancy, and many who have liked theſe, have ſnuffed at the Romiſh for their dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>SECT. 4. There being no fault in Ceremonies, nor their Significancy, there can be none in their Impoſition, both becauſe what is lawfull and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable may, <hi>&amp; pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> ought to be impoſed; and alſo if Superiours have authority it lies in this kind of things, becauſe the obſervation of theſe depends on their authority; what is certainly divine, whether Superiours enjoyn it or not, we are to doe for God's ſake; what is humane, when required by Superiours, we are to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100221:72"/> for their ſakes, who have received ſuch authority from God, what they exact in duties ſtanding by divine Law natural, or poſitive, is onely miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, what in others is judicial. But if ſignificant Ceremonies be due expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents in the publick worſhip of God, then for order and uniformity therein, it is neceſſary they be ſettled in a fixed determinate ſtate, becauſe if this be not obſerved, the ends for which they are expedient are not attainable. For as they will not reach the ends of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and edification, unleſs they be ſignificant, and by their ſignificancy expedient, ſo will they not procure unity and uniformity unleſs they be determined, and by virtue of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination unanimouſly and uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved. If then it be requiſite there be a ſtated order, this muſt be drawn either by God or Man. It is acknowledged by all hands, that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this nature are left by God to humane prudence, the order then muſt be from Man. But if from Man, then either from an agreement of the People, which is not, for ſuch lives not long, and ſo we muſt begin again; and as the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100221:73"/> proceſs will be <hi>in infinitum,</hi> ſo it is hard to find that ever any ſuch agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath been made; if there have, then I demand whether this agreement be obligatory or not? if not, the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a buſie nothing, the end pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended is no way ſecured; if it be, then it hath the nature of an impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that multitude ſo agreed, and each particular member thereof, and alſo the matter whatſoever it be in its kind, is reſolved by that conſenting impoſition neceſſary for its uſe, becauſe confeſſedly obliging by virtue of that concluſive agreement. Or elſe from ſome whom God hath entruſted and committed a power to order theſe things, which is the moſt natural and Scriptural way: and ſo if theſe impoſe there, there ariſeth an obligation to obſerve what is impoſed, becauſe there are expreſs commands for obedience to them in the word of God, ſo that a ſcrupuloſity ariſing from a mixt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion or doubting of the lawfulneſs of the matters impoſed will not acquit the Conſcience, becauſe he that diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth is damned as well as he that doubteth. It is no unwarrantable
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100221:73"/> groundleſs ſuppoſition, that if man had continued in the ſtate of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, even then a ſettled Government would have been provided, becauſe that after men were multiplied upon earth they would have drawn into So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities; but it is utterly unconceivable how the way of living in a Society could be effected without a ruling power to order it. <hi>Rivet. in Exod. 20. p.</hi> 157. brings this home to the ſpecial matter; <hi>Ritus externi, &amp;c.</hi> External rites proper and belonging to Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Polity, and for certain circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the worſhip of God, were no way unſuitable to that ſtate. For which he aſſigns this reaſon, <hi>p. 152. In ſtatu illo, &amp;c.</hi> In that ſtate men ſhould have entred into Society, and being entred, Eccleſiaſtical Polity ſhould have its place and uſe even in divine Worſhip. For, though in that ſtate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day would have been as an holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and there was nothing could have diverted man from the contemplation and worſhip of God, yet as, even then man, as a living Creature, might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion ſome time for the procurement of neceſſaries for humane life, ſo as a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100221:74"/> ſociable Creature he would ſubmit to order in his publick religious conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. This will hold the ſtronglier, if that Hypotheſis hold, that God by a poſitive Law commanded the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabbath to man before he lapſed; and concluded it is that <hi>Adam,</hi> being the firſt Parent of mankind, did exerciſe this ruling power over his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants, and the ſucceſſive Fathers of Families, after they were multiplied, did ſo by the Law of Primogeniture; ſo that ſuperiority and inferiority, and therefore ſubjection, ſtands by the Law of nature, otherwiſe the fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is no part thereof.</p>
               <p>SECT. 5. What was the reaſon of our firſt Reformers retaining Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, is expreſſed in the Preface to the Common-Prayer-Book, in the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation publiſhed and prefixed to it, in the Editions thereof in King <hi>James</hi> his time, which the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approved; and fully cleared by our excellent <hi>Jewel,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Part. 2. c. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diviſ.</hi> 1.

Actiones, &amp;c.</hi> Actions which are neither commanded nor forbidden by God, are not matters of obedience or diſobedience, (conſidered abſtractedly, as will ſoon appear from him) but are in their intrinſecal nature indifferent. Now all we affirm in this caſe is, that thoſe actions which in their latitude and nature are indifferent, are thereby free to be determined for practice, and being once ſo determined by Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, it is not indifferent for private perſons to croſs or thwart their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, to doe or not to doe thoſe indifferents, becauſe the determination to practice ſo far abates the indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of that middle indifferent thing, (which yet after the determination re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſuch in its kind.) If herein he doth not concur with us, I miſtake, for he âdds; The common nature of the thing is indifferent to good or evil, as it is
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100221:75"/> duly or unduly circumſtantiated. Now, ſay I, hence it follows, that the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, according to conformity or non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity, in the determination of that indifferent thing, is reſpectively either good or bad; good by their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to good, that is, if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the good of order, and unity, &amp;c. evil if we do not; he goes on, <hi>p.</hi> 191. ſuch geſtures are required in prayer, which are expreſſive of ſingular humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as uncovering the head, kneeling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> adding, <hi>p.</hi> 124. at ſolemn prayer it is fit, by the elevation of the hands and eyes, to declare our faith and hope in our heavenly Father, and by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures and ſigns to expreſs the inward motions; whereupon he determins, theſe indifferents may not ſimply, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and for perpetuity be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, yet as they tend to good they ought, and ought to be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by thoſe, who, <hi>authoritate pollent,</hi> are in chief authority. Therefore in his opinion, things indifferent in their nature, are good from their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and ſettlement in good order, and in reference to good ends; which (he farther ſays) needs not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100221:76"/> actual and explicit, a virtual is ſufficient, and is as much as is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required, which obviates that cavil of <hi>Pyrgopal.</hi> in his anſwer to Dr. <hi>Durel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His third comes yet more home, <hi>Med. Theol. l. 2. c. 14. n.</hi> 23. where he grants other circumſtances (as <hi>J.</hi> O. ordered) with an [and the like] but with this difference, <hi>J.</hi> O. terms them natural, which he ſticks not to call the common adjuncts of religious and civil acts, but by others (whom he cenſures not) are called religious Rites, or Eccleſiaſtical Ceremonies; the neglect and contempt whereof is in ſome meaſure a kind of violation of the holineſs of Religion, and cannot be ſeparated from it, but in ſome manner we derogate from the majeſty and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity thereof. Then he gives his full judgment of them, <hi>n.</hi> 24. Theſe are not particularly commanded in Scripture, nay, its below the majeſty thereof to preſcribe them, but they are left to moral prudence, <hi>n.</hi> 27. Theſe Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions thus determined, are truly ſaid by the beſt Divines to be partly divine, and partly humane; partly divine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in their higheſt and primary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100221:76"/> they depend on the will of God, commanding them in general; <hi>n.</hi> 24. partly humane, becauſe as to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular obſervation they depend on hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane prudence; yet ſo, that if there be no errour in their Conſtitution they are to be eſteemed and accepted, <hi>quaſiſimpliciter,</hi> and as if they were ſimply and abſolutely divine.</p>
               <p>To recapitulate what he hath deter-mined in the point.</p>
               <p>There are things indifferent in their common nature and kind, theſe indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferents, when by ſpecial determination through their tendency to good they are applied thereto, are good; Eccleſiaſtical Rites and Ceremonies when thus duly circumſtantiated are in the account of thoſe indifferents: theſe Ceremonies ſhould be ſignificant, expreſſive of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and humility, of our faith and hope in God; theſe ſignificant expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ought to be conſtituted, theſe Conſtitutions are to be ordered by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane prudence, this humane prudence is that of thoſe who precide in chief, theſe ſo ordered are religiouſly to be obſerved, and to neglect or contemn them, is to derogate from the majeſty
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100221:77"/> of religious Worſhip, and to violate its holineſs; and laſtly, the obſervation of them is acceptable to God (ſay Mr. <hi>Cawdry</hi> to the contrary what he can) by virtue of the Fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and ſo <hi>Ameſius</hi> his Evidence is ſummed up.</p>

Mr. <hi>Perkins, Demonſt. Problem. p. 232. n.</hi> 6. aſſerts this; Holy they are, not in and for themſelves, but for the holy duties then performed to God. Dr. <hi>Rivet</hi> in <hi>Ex. 20. p.</hi> 167. declares, A relative holineſs belongeth to them, and they might very properly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Holidays, <hi>ratione finis,</hi> in reſpect to their ends and uſes, being ſeparated for holy exerciſes.

               <p>THE laſt which is oppoſed, is the Doctrine of the Church, exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified in the Book of Articles. The Independent <hi>Sophi</hi> hath expreſſed ſo great kindneſs for 36 of them, that by his Verdict, woe be to him that ſhall diſpute them, no leſs correction will ſatisfie his tender Conſcience than exile; but away with the other three, if they be not removed, no <hi>recipe</hi> of reformation or condeſcenſion will work kindly with him. All this is but a Copy of his Countenance, when he puts on his conſidering Cap ſomewhat elſe muſt march off and be disbanded. Certainly for his dear ſake, and the good ſervice he expects from his Herd and Comerades, the ſix Homilies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Rebellion muſt be caſhiered, and caſt off to the dogs. Well! This is onely one Doctour's opinion; A very good Friend of his would have the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Article quite cut off, becauſe therein (as he ſagely gueſſeth) the Church is defined directly as the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100221:82"/> define it. In good time! till theſe two be agreed about the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, there is little hopes of the much talked of Union; how this noble reflexion will go down with him, let him certifie when the project of Union is effected; but for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that he may take heart again, that ſuggeſtion of the noble Peer was the product of his malice and ignorance. For the Church of <hi>England</hi> reprobates Independency (which is, that every particular Congregation is an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Body, not ſubordinate to any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Eccleſiaſtical Authority, as <hi>Spanhem.

This is remarkable, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the beginning of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s Reign, returning home from <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> broached <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Doctrine here, one whereof wrote a ſmart Letter to an ancient Divine, who had been exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led too, charging him for his oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that Doctrine with Pelagianiſm, whereunto he, <hi>ſecundo Eliz.</hi> framed an Anſwer, wherein he purged himſelf and others of his judgment from the imputation, and by way of recrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proved the Calviniſts to be Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100221:83"/> But a dapper younker, and through paced Bigot, is not onely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at theſe before excepted, but falls foul on the Sixth Article; what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him at this, I cannot conjecture, unleſs he bogled at the <hi>Apocrypha;</hi> but perhaps I may gueſs what heated him againſt the One and Twentieth Article; forſooth, in his wiſe judgment, the Kirk with its Provincials may meet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without the King's leave firſt obtained, and ſit too contrary to his expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. I may alſo poſſibly hit at his diſpleaſure at the Thirty Fourth Article, becauſe by it he and his Drove muſt be concluded Schiſmaticks. Great reaſon he had to keck at the Thirty Sixth Article: For when he was preſented to the Claſs of revolted Miniſters with their Lay-Elders for Ordination, they were not provided at firſt for a caſt of their Office; for not knowing how to pick out a form of Ordination from the Directory, they were at a loſs till they received one from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and then they gravely proceeded; to work they went on all hands without any ſcruple, that they had ſtinted the Spirit in the uſe of that ſet Form.</p>

For, upon his coming into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he was efforted with the <hi>Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus</hi> Petition, which was convincing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuted by both Univerſities, and ſlighted by the King, yet ſo, that he promiſed them a conference at <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Court, which proved as unlucky to them, as the Diſputation <hi>Primo Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zab.</hi> had been to the Papiſts. Meeting then with theſe diſappointments they cooled in the queſt of their Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-work by Petitions and Motions, falling upon new methods of miſchief. Theſe were by malicious cloſe ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions to infuſe groundleſs fears and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies into the minds of well-meaning men. To manage which more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly for their deſperate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive deſigns, they, perceiving the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100221:93"/> people to be great lovers of an Image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Liberty, and of the eſtabliſhed Religion, plaid their Game under the colour of advancing the Liberty of the Subject (which they reſolved to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs) and the preſervation of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion eſtabliſhed by Law (which they intended to deſtroy) by degrees thus cunningly working themſelves into a State Faction. To make this more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular they ceaſed not to alarm the Kingdom with the deſperate ends the Papiſts propoſed to themſelves. This ſtrategeme they ſo cloſely followed and craftily improved, that in the firſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of the moſt Chriſtian King, <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr, and incomparable Prince in all religious and honourable accompliſhments, they induſtriouſly repreſented the growth of Popery, and the dangerous Plots of the Papiſts and popiſhly affected, that the thoughts both of King and People being taken up with theſe fears, they might without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation increaſe into numbers and ſtrength. The King well enough diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned this, though at firſt he would not make it openly known, hoping the Gentlemen would calm, but they
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100221:93"/> grew madder; therefore at long run, in the Second Seſſion of this Third Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, he was neceſſitated to tell them roundly, That he looked on this pretence, as a deſign to divert from all ſuch buſineſſes as he had recommended to them, under colour of taking care for this. But by purſuing theſe arts they at length got the <hi>Militia</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at their diſpoſal, being aſſiſted thereto by the perjurious, treacherous practices of the Schiſmatical and Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical Members of the great City, and ſeconded by an Army of moſt perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, hypocritical Scots, with whom they agreed for brotherly aſſiſtence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on moſt diſhonourable terms. Now to find out their hypocriſie, they, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus prepared) left the Papiſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleſted, as an inconſiderable party not worth looking after, farther than to drive on their deviliſh deſigns; to which end, they remitted to ſome the penalties of the Law exacted for their Recuſancy. <hi>Pym,</hi> one of their great ſticklers, took a bribe of thirty pounds of one of them, as was averred againſt him, <hi>his Majeſty's Declaration, Aug.</hi> 2. 1642. others of them they ſeduced
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:100221:94"/> from their Loyalty, entertaining them in their Army, twenty or thirty being taken in one Troop or Company, <hi>his Majeſty's Declaration</hi> upon the Battel at <hi>Edgehill.</hi> (This the Villains in great hypocriſie objected againſt the King) and promiſing to others, if they would aſſiſt them againſt the King, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal or relax all the penal Laws againſt Recuſancy. Nay, they publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>Octob.</hi> 6. 1642. That if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts would bring in any conſiderable Sum upon the Propoſitions (thoſe, by which they had drawn from the City and other Counties eleven millions; the Authour of the Hiſtory of the two <hi>Junto</hi>'s ſays more) they ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and its credibly reported, they hired <hi>Owen Roe O-neal</hi> to raiſe the Siege at <hi>London Derry,</hi> when beleagured by his Majeſty's Forces, <hi>Hiſt.

What diſmal effects thoſe prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices at laſt produced are generally known, yet this ought to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, That overtures upon overtures, condeſcentions upon condeſcentions, conceſſions upon conceſſions were not onely offered but confirmed to them, which onely emboldened and animated
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100221:94"/> them to farther inſolent and unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable demands: They had always nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Propoſitions in readineſs, which they knew could not be granted in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or conſcience; if they had, they had more in their Budgets, or elſe the old ones muſt have a new conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſuit with the ſenſe of the <hi>Bigots</hi> and <hi>Boutefeus,</hi> in good earneſt, true Proteſtant Gypſies and Guſmans; which will be fullier diſcovered in the next conſideration.</p>

Once a crew of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, It was in the Princes power to reform or remove an ungodly Clergy, their meaning was, to collogue a little, and to ſtep into their preferments, wherein when they failed, then the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100221:95"/> tide turned. Princes have nothing to doe in Eccleſiaſtical affairs, but to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Decrees of the Kirk, which gallant Mr. <hi>Traverſe</hi> thus held forth; They are to ſubmit their Sceptres, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which by his reference to <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 23. is in plain Engliſh to ſay, They are to lick the duſt of the Presbyters feet, and kiſs their toes. In <hi>an.</hi> 1605. a Club of them proteſted, The Magiſtrate needs not reſpect Law, he may diſpenſe with it, or favourably interpret it (ſure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for their ſakes) but if he prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe it, where they are not concerned, then the cry goes, he attempts an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Government, their liberty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and Religion lies at hap hazard. Sometimes the Law is a Bulwark to fence out Tyranny, on a ſudden its an humane invention, and God's people muſt order their lives according to God's word, and doe the work of their heavenly Father. Now they have ſo great reverence for Oaths, they are not free to take them, anon they will glibly down with them, and again vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them, and Apologize for the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of them; no Oaths can bind the Conſcience againſt the Reformation,

Time was when the thirteenth to the <hi>Romans</hi> was onely ſafe counſel, or a politickly contrived Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, when King was the King in his Courts, not in his perſon, and the damnation threatned, was lying in Priſon, or ſuffering on a Gibbet; The caſe is ſoon altered with the times, and then upon every revolution Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake no longer like a Stateſman, but as a Caſuiſt, not in point of prudence, but Conſcience, firſt to the Patriots,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100221:96"/> then to the Keepers, then to <hi>Noll,</hi> in all which changes, damnation was changed from loſs or bondage into wrath to come and eternal vengeance. For a long time their talk was of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and their ſucceſſes; firſt their cauſe was God's cauſe, which he would proſper for their ſakes (his People, his fecret Ones) and for his promiſes, whereof they had a large ſtock in the Old Teſtament, and the <hi>Revelations;</hi> (this had a ſtrong ſmack of prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) then God proſpered their cauſe, therefore it was God's cauſe, (a pure Mahometan concluſion;) now that its at a loſs, the note is, (and mark it, I beſeech you) God in the ways of his Providence towards us walks in the dark, the good people muſt unite till the day appears, and the good hour comes; in the mean time, let us make our appeals to God, as the <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Conventicling Doctour <hi>Gilpin</hi> held forth, <hi>an.</hi> 1671. and be very carefull that our zeal to God be not interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our duty to the King; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, be free to ſupport your pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pretious Preachers, that we want not tongues and hands for the old cauſe.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100221:96"/> They conſtantly condemn that in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which is their common practice. Monopolies were once a grievance, yet the Drivers were very liberal in their Grants of ſuch to their officious tools, <hi>King's Declaration, Aug.</hi> 12. 1642. and in his Declaration concerning the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at <hi>Oxford.</hi> They made an hideous hubbub that ſubſcription to ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of peace was required of thoſe that pretended a deſire to take upon them the miniſterial Function, yet they themſelves were rigid exactours in the like caſe. They ſcorn all the Canons and Conſtitutions of the Church, as the Precepts of men, but every one at his peril muſt ſubmit to the orders of their Synods. They fiercely inveigh againſt Impoſitions; Oh! they are apt to whet humane nature (very humble patient men they the mean time) to wild and forbidden courſes; (This looks not onely like a charge againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but a threatning too) yet theſe murmurers againſt lawfull authority interdicted the Common-Prayer-Book by penalties from five pounds to ten, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and obtruded the Directory by a penalty from five pounds to fifty: and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100221:97"/> that Impoſition of <hi>July,</hi> 25. 1684. was at once both Antiehriſtianly traiterous and tyrannical. They tartly tax the Romaniſts (juſtly enough as to the matter of the charge) for clipping and cutting the Tongues of their Writers, yet moſt unjuſtly, becauſe hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally as to themſelves, who uſe the ſame craft. That moſt perſpicuous paſſage of <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Epiſtle to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Sadolet,</hi> wherein he declareth, They deſerve to be anathematized who reject Epiſcopacy, where it may be retained (which is really to pronounce an Anathema on all our Engliſh Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) is quite purged out in the two latter Editions of <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Gellaſius.</hi> This was diſcovered by the Right Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend and learned Authour of that Treatiſe called, <hi>The Serpent Salve, p.</hi> 220. What was to be found in the <hi>Argentorate</hi> Edition of <hi>Bucer,</hi> is left out in the <hi>Geneva,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> enforms us. The Authour of the <hi>Friendly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, par. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 404. hath detected the like fraud in corrupting Dr. <hi>Sibbs's</hi> Treatiſe called, <hi>The Souls Conflict.</hi> The words of <hi>John Careleſs,</hi> in reference to the Common-Prayer-Book, at his exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination

If it were certainly known what their deſign was in the Tickets which were diſpatched into the ſeveral Counties, before Saint <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> 1662. their hypocriſie would be ſo laid open that no Apology could be made. Thus much I know, it was to aſſure their inferiour ſort of Miniſters, that with their good leave, they might comply and conform, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100221:98"/> if they prevailed in the deſign they were then carrying on, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their preſent compliance, they would favourably entertain, and as it ſhould happen, prefer them.</p>

                     <hi>Num.</hi> 3. They are a ſingular Sect, divided from the whole viſible Church, and every particular regularly formed Church throughout the whole Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world. This we are ſure, if they lived in any ſuch Church, and acted there in oppoſition to their eſtabliſhed Forms and Rites, they would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded unſufferable Schiſmaticks, and be more ſharply handled than here they are or have been. They are true Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maelites, <hi>Iſhmael was a wild man, his hand was againſt every man, and every man's hand was againſt him,</hi> Gen. 16. 12. They conclude all the Chriſtian world beſides their Brethren in iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be Antichriſtian, and all Chriſtian Chruches condemn them as Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. They diſſent from this Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church whereof they are or ought to be Members, and in that reſpect they diſſent from the Catholick Church primitive and ſucceſſive; But this, ſay
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100221:98"/> ſome, is hard meaſure, they are our Brethren, and our Proteſtant Brethren. In good time! that now at laſt (upon a miſchievous deſign which is eaſily underſtood and might be ſoon mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted) Malignants from 40 to 60 ſhould be taken in into the number of the Brethren; ſure we are, they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved harder meaſure from theſe their falſe Brethren, than <hi>Jacob</hi> did from his Brother <hi>Edom, Obad. 10, &amp;c.</hi> They are in the Scripture notion ſtrange Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who can find in their hearts to plunder, and murther their now lately adopted Brethren. But how comes theſe (dear Brethren with a miſchief) to be dubbed Proteſtants? Are they ſo called becauſe they diſſent from all Proteſtant Churches? Proteſtant ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies with them another thing than a reformed Catholick, which every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant is, or elſe he is no true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. Three acceptations of the word [Proteſtant] are now in faſhion; for firſt, Proteſtants are a Set of preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in oppoſition to, and excluſion of all others who profeſs Chriſtianity, if this be their notion they are pure Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts, and the excluſioners have as
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100221:99"/> much Antichriſtian pride and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs, as the Pope, or his moſt bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted Papalins; it's an aſſumed name, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as the Greeks name it, who juſtly eſteem every ſuch a badge of diviſion and apoſtaſie. <hi>Lact.</hi> (a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin too) thought ſo, <hi>Chriſtiani eſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſierunt, &amp;c.</hi> They ceaſe to be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who, forſaking the name of Chriſt, uſurp to themſelves humane and alien denominations. Or, ſecondly, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants are but Antipapiſts, all who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and oppoſe the Pope's Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, without any more to do, commence Proteſtants; in ſhort, they are no Papiſts, therefore they are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, or which is far more abſurd, they are enemies, ſworn and foreſworn enemies to Epiſcopacy and Monarchy, and they then are true Proteſtants. The Demagogues, and Sectaries do frequently thus ſenſe it, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to reproach it, and make it odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to all who love peace and truth. For then all Doctour <hi>Stillingfleet's</hi> Gnats, which are now metamorphoſed into Vipers, then all Doctour <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tredinous Vermin of bold and frantick
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100221:99"/> Sectaries (ſo he honoured them <hi>Ser. before Comm. Nov.</hi> 5. 1641. who ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while were his Bandogs, which he let looſe and hounded on the King and Biſhops) muſt be honoured with this title. Then Socinians, Anabaptiſts, Familiſts, Antinomians, Swinckfeldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; yea, all Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> Jugglers, the Hiders, whom he ſubdivides into Vaniſts, Paracelſians, Weigelians, Beh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with his Seekers, whom he again ſubdivides into ſix more vile ranks, muſt be dignified with this (not to be deſpiſed, as not to be too much extolled) title. Or, laſtly, Proteſtants were thoſe learned and pious men, who endeavoured the retrieval of the Primitive, Catholick and Apoſtolick Faith and Uſages from the innovations and corruptions which had overſpread and polluted the Church. What they did was to reduce the Church into its primitive ſtate in the ſimplicity and purity of Faith, and redreſs abuſes in practice, reſerving ſtill a power in each particular Church to determine for it ſelf, what God hath left undetermined for unity, order and edification, with the cloſeſt conſonancy to the rules and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100221:100"/> obſervations of the ancient Catholick Doctours and Fathers. If this (which indeed is the true notion of the Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative) be intended, the Diſſenters are to all intents and purpoſes for ever bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from any claim to it, unleſs they mend their manners, which is ſcarce to be hoped. For as a learned man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, They know they are in the wrong as well as we can tell them, but all the world will not make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and amend. As the caſe now ſtands, they cannot challenge any right either to the name; or to the thing. Not to the name; for neither they, nor any of their Sect were in <hi>Germany, an.</hi> 1529. when the Diſciples were firſt called Proteſtants, upon a proteſtation and appeal from the Decree of <hi>Spira</hi> unto <hi>Coeſar,</hi> and a General Council. Nor to the thing; For neither they, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny commiſſioned by them, did ever ſubſcribe to the Auguſtan Confeſſion, neither will they now be concluded by it, nor will they ſubmit to the harmony of Confeſſions induſtriouſly drawn, as the proper Teſt of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, to diſtinguiſh true Proteſtants from falſe pretenders to the name. It
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100221:100"/> is therefore mere mockery to affirm them Proteſtants, who proteſt againſt true Proteſtancy, and the reſolutions of all formed Proteſtant Churches. But if they muſt be called ſo, it muſt be by an odd Figure, the ſame by which a ſchiſmatical, traiterous Conventicle patched up of Clergy-men, Stateſ-men, Sword-men and Lawyers was once called an Aſſembly of Divines. Their agreement (if any ſuch there be) in the ſame common principles of Faith, (which are arbitrary as to them,) will not gain them the denomination of Proteſtant, nor beget the relation of Proteſtant Brethren. For then the Pope and his adherents muſt be Proteſtants, and our Proteſtant Brethren to boot; and with great reaſon, becauſe they earneſtly contend for the firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Oracles of God, and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Chriſt, which ſeveral of the Fanaticks either oppoſe or ſcruple. Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> will not blame the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts for believing too little, but too much, which theſe heretical Blades are faulty in too, as well as they. The Pope, or Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by a preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med infallibility of judgment from a
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100221:101"/> Divine endowment aſſumes a power to declare (which in practice is to mint and coin) Articles of Faith; ſo the Sectaries hold forth their ſingular opinions, and Enthuſiaſtical dotages, as demonſtrations of Spirit: More plainly thus; The Roman Chairman with his Conclave or a Council, takes upon them to define falſe or diſputed opinions, as matters of Faith, which thereupon they enter into their Creed, to be believed as abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation; The Sectarian Chairmen with their Benchers and Aſſociates paſs Problems in their Syſtemes and Synods for Divine Revelations and Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, which they exemplifie in their Catechiſms, and Confeſſions of Faith, as the Oracles of God. Now they are as infamous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane prevaricators of Divine Law, who preach up their private fancies, and ſentiments, for infallible Soul-ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Doctrines, as thoſe who equalize their particular Traditions with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible word of God. The learned and judicious Biſhop <hi>Davenant</hi> thought ſo, <hi>Adhort. ad Pacem. Eccleſ. c. 1. p.</hi> 43. I (ſays he) think it is all one to obtrude
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100221:101"/> our controverted points on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men in the ſame degree of neceſſity with the moſt perſpicuous Doctrines of the Goſpel, as to confound unwritten Traditions with the written word of God. Mr. <hi>Newcomen,</hi> a ſprig of <hi>Smect.</hi> is herein poſitive, Their hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (ſpeaking of thoſe who withdrew Communion from the Presbyterians, and gathered themſelves into ſeparate Congregations) one Head, and one Faith doth not excuſe them of down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Schiſm, ſo long as they hold not one Body and one Baptiſm, <hi>Serm.</hi> at <hi>Paul's Croſs, Febr.</hi> 18. 1646. The to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſum is; The Religion eſtabliſhed by Law in this Church from which they ſeparate, is either the true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, or not; if not, then none of the Tranſmarine Reformed Churches, underſtand the Proteſtant Religion. For all of them do own this as ſuch, and every of them will prefer this before any other but their own, which moſt men are apt to overvalue. If it is, then the Abettors of a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion and Intereſt different from, and oppoſite to it, do confound and deſtroy the Proteſtant Religion
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100221:102"/> and intereſt, and the Diſſenters from it are not to be reputed Proteſtants, but a ſingular ſchiſmatical Sect.</p>
                  <p>SECT. 3. Having proceeded thus far, that there ought not be a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the preſent Eſtabliſhment, whether we reſpect the matters upon which this Innovation-work muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, or the perſons for whoſe behoof it is propoſed and deſigned; on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den up ſtants a new Set of men miſno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mened, the moderate or ſober party, who lately in the Kirk's cenſure were deteſtable Neuters. Theſe, though no faſt Friends to the cauſe, yet are well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſhers to it, as appears by the pleas they put up in its behalf, the chiefeſt whereof is, (the reſt are pitifull Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brages) There is no way left to prevent Popiſh Idolatry (which they too truly affirm to come on apace by our divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) than by condeſcenſion to, and compliance with the Diſſenters; But this ſmoaky ſhadow is ſoon diſſolved and blown away.</p>

It can be no part of prudence to preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate our ſelves into thoſe waſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive confuſions, and tragical deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and miſeries out of which by the all-wiſe providence of our good God we have ſo lately eſcaped, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a remote poſſible danger, and to part with our religious and civil Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to gratifie a generation of Vipers and Hypocrites who will never be gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by any condeſcenſions, nor can be agreed with, unleſs they have their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent as well as trifling demands to an infinite proceſs granted. This is all one as to put my Coat a daying (in another of our Northern Saws) when I know, he who ſeeks it will ſtand to no award, unleſs I give it him.</p>
                  <p>2. In Caſe Divinity, we may not doe evil, that good may come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, a good intention will not hallow a bad action; neither to decline one evil of ſin, may we hurry into another.

It cannot be Religion to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent an imminent ſuſpected danger, by contracting and incurring the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain guilt of Schiſm and Sacrilege, both which are as oppoſite to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an piety, eſpecially when maintained with pertinacy. This is known, the ancient Chriſtians equalized Schiſm with Idolatry, which was then of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt figure; and certain it is, that <hi>Korah's</hi> Schiſm, or perhaps Mutiny onely, was more dreadfully avenged than the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Idolatry; even Schiſmaticks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will confeſs it an heinous crime but to countenance or abett a Schiſm. And if Mr. <hi>Calvin's</hi> judgment may be taken, S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 2. adjudged Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege to be a ſin of the ſame kind with Idolatry. Now to ſeparate from that Church, which, in the judgment of the moſt eminent Proteſtants, is the beſt Reformed Catholick Church, is Schiſm; and to refuſe to give God that external adoration, which under the Goſpel belongs to him, is Sacrilege; in both which reſpects the Diſſenters being criminal, they are found guilty
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100221:103"/> by publick judgment both of Schiſm and Sacrilege.</p>
                  <p>SECT. 4. The deſign of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes is not to exaſperate them, that is more than needs, their rage and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice is at full Sea, they are already ſo madded, they will follow their courſe, (if not ſtopped by an high hand,) with or without any external provocations; but to diſcover their aims at preſent, which is to make us forget their former actings, and to hope well of them for the future, and over and above to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they are juſtly compared to the worſt of Papiſts, the Jeſuites.

Their avowed principles and actings are originally Jeſuitical, ſuch as their diſpenſing with Oaths lawfully taken, their induſtrious ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Kingly authority, their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of propagating by ſome of them, and by others of defending, Religion by the ſword againſt lawfull authority. They have taken upon themſelves as ſo many Popes to command or prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit matters of Doctrine and Diſcipline, merely, <hi>ex imperio voluntatis,</hi> by an
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100221:104"/> arbitrary power. They have ſworn and vowed to maintain an ambulatory cauſe, never to be convinced of an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, or to confeſs that ever they were in the wrong, and their Herd and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans have aſſociated and engaged to believe all the Declarations, to obſerve all the crackt Ordinances, to preſerve all the claimed Rights, and uſurped Privileges of the Caballers, and to ſtand by and aſſiſt theſe their Repreſentatives and worthy Patriots with their lives and fortunes, right or wrong, in a blind obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, all which are as bad, and ſome of them worſe than any Jeſuitical Vows.</p>

Such pernicious methods as they have ſometimes openly purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and at all times are cloſely purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, makes a ready way for Popery; firſt viſibly, by dividing and diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Church, and obſtructing and fruſtrating all methods of Union; and ſecondly, more covertly, it being ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unaccountable for the Church to yield, eſpecially conſidering that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will ſatisfie them, unleſs they be acknowledged the godly conſcientious
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100221:104"/> Party, whereby they keep up their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation with the Rabble, who upon that ſuppoſition will be ready to joyn with them in any of their confounding deſigns, and all their former deteſtable actings be pronounced juſt and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, and their traiterous War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King be declared lawfull; but ſuppoſing that in theſe or ſome of theſe they ſhould be gratified, yet that will not ſerve the turn, unleſs Schiſm be ſettled by Law, which if once it be, the Papiſts will gain this advantage, our Religion is unſtable, feveriſh and (in Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s expreſſion) vertigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.

It is evident the preſent Diſſenters walk in the ſame track the former Rebels had trodden out, which they are unwilling to have recounted to them, becauſe they have ſtill a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to follow it. Thoſe made ſharp reflexions on the Government, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the errours (which were moſtly
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:100221:105"/> feigned) and misfortunes thereof, to amuſe and diſtract the populacy, and alienate their affections from it; ſo do theſe. Thoſe told us the Sectaries were innocent harmleſs Creatures; ſo do theſe. Thoſe boaſted of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and intereſt; theſe much more and higher. In brief, what thoſe pleaded for themſelves and their unaccountable actings, theſe do with virulent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious improvements. Now may theſe drive on their deſigns in the ſame way they always firſt ſet out to harden the people againſt their lawfull Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and ſhall not the true Sons of the Church endeavour to undeceive them, and endear them to love, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and obey the King, and all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively that are in authority under him? If we may not diſcourſe of their former actings, why was the King's Book publiſhed, and appointed to be kept in all Churches? or why do we obſerve annually the 30th. of <hi>January?</hi> Is it onely to tell ſtories of the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous villanies that day committed? and not rather to encline and effectually move us to repent of thoſe wicked principles and practices preparatory to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100221:105"/> them? If the Sectarian Rebels may talk of the Papiſts and their Plots, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Act of Oblivion and Indemnity, why not the affectionate Royal uſe the ſame freedom againſt the Puritans? The endeavours of both Papiſts and Puritans when inviſible and under ground are equally dangerous, when viſible and acted above board e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually miſchievous. Never was there a Rebellion contrived with greater hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, begun upon leſs provocations (<hi>ubi minus motivum majus peccatum</hi>) nor managed with more ſavage barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, than that of the late Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sectaries and Republican Atheiſts; even that moſt execrable Popiſh Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſeems not to exceed it, ſcarce to equal it. The differences of both are laid down by a very know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excellent perſon, in his Tract (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned) entituled, <hi>Serpent Salve, p. 193. &amp; inde.</hi> Indeed the Kirk Traitours profeſſed they were grieved they were compared with Papiſts in point of allegiance and fidelity, and that therein they ſuffered an hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from all the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (<hi>ergo,</hi> the Reformed Churches

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100221:108"/> thought the taking away the King's Life [in that manner] (for that's their phraſe) was unjuſtifiable, but it might be done warrantably enough in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner; and it juſtifies what <hi>Noll</hi> ſaid of them, Presbyterians are not ſo much troubled at the King's death, as that they had not the chief hand and ſtroke in it.

                  <p n="1">1. They initiate them with Faſtings, ſolemn Vows and Promiſes, Sermons and Sacraments, though thereby they proſtitute all the Ordinances of God, to enchant and bind them faſt in the Confederacy.</p>

That Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> freely declared, (contrary, it ſeems, to the judgment of the main body of the Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) that ſilence unlawfull which juſtly cauſeth ſuſpicion of evil, as of Treaſon and Sedition, (See more in Biſhop <hi>Bancroft's Survey</hi>) which how frequently of late hath been practiſed, is too notorious.</p>
                  <p>SECT. 5. Seeing then the Puritan principles are as dangerous as the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitical, and their practices, when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous, as deſtructive; no reaſon can be aſſigned by the received rules of common prudence, why Puritans ſhould enjoy the privileges of comprehenſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Papiſts debarred. For common prudence will determine all
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:100221:110"/> under the ſame guilt ſhould be liable to the ſame ſentence of condemnation. What the reaſons of State may be to grant a toleration or privilege to one party and not to the other is not to be diſputed or ſawcily examined by infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, or if the Government pleaſe to relax or repeal the Laws to both. This is plain, the higher power may with as good reaſon diſpenſe with the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Law, as inferiour, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Charter or Commiſſion Officers, may wave and in a manner out-law them in favour of a party, though thereby they run the hazard of perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and perfidiouſneſs. All wiſe men (as a great wiſe man hath obſerved) deſire to live under ſuch a Government, where the Prince with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may remit the rigour of the Laws; as for thoſe that are otherwiſe minded, I wiſh them no other puniſhment but this, that the penal Laws may be ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed upon them, till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their judgment. If therefore the arguments which are alledged for the ſtanding of the Laws againſt Papiſts be good, as I am perſuaded they are, then the ſame reaſons will much more evince
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100221:110"/> the Laws againſt Puritans ſhould ſtill be upheld, which will the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if thoſe arguments be produced and applied. They are theſe,</p>
                  <p>1. The queſtion is, whether Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be not Treaſon becauſe a man thinks himſelf bound in Conſcience to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it? It is reſolved in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
                  <p>This turns the Puritans pretence of Conſcience in the like caſes quite out of doors, for no man's Conſcience can alter the nature of things, that that which is evil ſhould become good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Conſcience, that is, his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted judgment, tells him it is ſo; or that which is good to become evil, by a perſuaſion of Conſcience, that is, becauſe he is ſo inſtructed or conceited. Now the Jeſuits are as ſtrait laced in their Conſciences as the Puritans are, thinking themſelves as faſt bound by the Popes Decrees and their own Vows, as the Puritans do from their Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and Leaguings, or from the Votes and Reſolutions of their Dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues.</p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:100221:111"/>
                  <p>2. Whether Magiſtrates have not reaſon to make ſevere Laws, when dangerous and deſtructive principles to Government are embraced as part of Religion? It is affirmed.</p>
                  <p>Here the caſe is the ſame again, both parties aver the lawfulneſs of reſiſting the civil Magiſtrate under colour of Religion, both hold the ſame treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable principles in ſubſtance and terms, differing onely in the power to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant them. The Jeſuits deriving it from the Pope, the Puritans from the determinations of their Kirk Aſſemblies, or their Patriots; and this we know, this Kingdom would never endure to be ſo far enſlaved to the Pope as it was to that traiterous Crew: Inteſtine broils, confuſions and uſurpations are more deſtructive than the challenges and filchings of a Foreigner; and our late glorious King ſaid, It was more honourable for a King to be invaded and almoſt deſtroyed by a foreign ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, than to be deſpiſed at home. <hi>Bibl. Reg. p.</hi> 286.</p>
                  <p>3. Civil Magiſtrates have in them a natural inherent right and power to preſerve the Government, and puniſh
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100221:111"/> thoſe who diſturb it, or would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it, and therefore an authority to judge of thoſe actions which are dangerous to it. This hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the Civil Magiſtrate, that the actions of both have been and are dangerous to the Government, and over and above, that the actions of the Puritans tend to the diſhonour of God, to the prejudice and ruine of the ſafety and peace both of Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; witneſs the preambles to the firſt and ſecond Acts of Uniformity, and many more.</p>
                  <p>4. Where there is a ſuſpicion of a number of perſons not eaſily diſcerned, the Laws may make uſe of certain Marks to diſcover them, although it happens that thoſe (as praying and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching) be actions of Religion, which are not therefore made the cauſe of their ſufferings, but thoſe principles and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were the firſt occaſions and motives of making thoſe Laws; for the performing Offices of Religion or of their function is not the motive of the Law, or the reaſon of the penalty, but merely the means to diſcover their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, not as the thing which makes
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:100221:112"/> them guilty, but as the way of finding out the guilty.</p>
                  <p>Then the Puritans meeting and conventicling in deſpite of Law is a way to notifie their guilt, and when they ſuffer for the performance of that which they call their Calling, though as to many of them never called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to either by God or man, from and under him, they ſuffer not for their praying and preaching, but for their principles, which they have maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and will not yet retract, and the actions which they practiſed, and ſtill would juſtifie; neither is their praying and preaching the cauſe of their ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, but are onely the means to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the perſons of thoſe who are of ſuch dangerous principles, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to act according to them.</p>
                  <p>5. In a jealous time, when many treaſons have been acted, and more are feared, by bad principles, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment may juſtly proceed upon the trial of the principles to the conviction of the perſons who own them, without plain evidence of the particular guilt of the outward actions of Treaſons. For he that owns the principles of Treaſon
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:100221:112"/> wants onely an opportunity to act them, and therefore in great dangers the not renouncing thoſe principles may juſtly expoſe them to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Law.</p>
                  <p>By this the Puritans are concluded as well as the Jeſuits; for as theſe ſtill adhere to the Papal Sentence, ſo they to their former Reſolutions, who have acted as many ſorts of Treaſons as the wit of Lawyers could diſcover. Maſter <hi>Baxter,</hi> one of the Fanatick Chieftains, cannot yet ſee he was miſtaken in the main Cauſe, nor dare venture to repent of it; yet dare ſay, he would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the doing of the ſame thing, if it were to doe again, <hi>Holy Commonwealth, p.</hi> 489. ſo ſaith their Foreman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo ſay they all; yet <hi>Ameſius, l. 4. de Conſc. c.</hi> 15. tells us plainly, They who will not confeſs and recant publick wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are ſtill impenitent, which if they be, they are in a forwardneſs to react them when they dare. But it is ſaid, They are at preſent harmleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Creatures; ſo the Donatiſts, when they could not doe miſchief, (juſt as Thieves are honeſt when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacled) boaſted to their great huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100221:113"/> toward the Orthodox; ſo did <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian,</hi> to whom S. <hi>Aug. l. 2. adverſus Pet. c.</hi> 83. did thus reply, <hi>Iſto modo, &amp;c.</hi> A Kite is a Dove when he cannot ſeiſe of a Dove, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi enim, &amp;c.</hi> For when, I pray you, did you ſpare us, when you were able? and when <hi>Rogatian</hi> (a great Stickler for Toleration) made the like bragg, S. <hi>Aug. Ep. 48. ad Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen.</hi> anſwers, <hi>Nulla beſtia, &amp;c.</hi> There is no beaſt reputed tame becauſe it hath neither teeth nor talons to doe hurt withall; you ſay you will not miſchief us, I rather think you cannot; for how will you not doe what poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly you can, ſeeing you ceaſe not to be doing and plotting when you can doe nothing at all?</p>
                  <p>6. In quiet times, the Law being in force keeps perſons of dangerous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples more in awe, (though it be not rigorouſly executed) who will be very cautious of broaching and maintaining their principles, and conſequently have not ſo bad effect as when they have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to vent them.</p>
                  <p>The Fanaticks are herein more bold and inſolent who preſume (though they have no liberty granted) to aſſert
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:100221:113"/> their ſchiſmatical Fancies and enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Dotages, witneſs <hi>Rich. Baxter</hi>'s and <hi>J. O</hi>'s Writings, with many more, that we cannot affirm the times are quiet and peaceable. For peace is not onely expoſed to external force and outrages, which is the common accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to the not having the ſame mind in love and accord, which is the Scripture ſenſe; and it is a ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of many Souls knit together in what is honeſt or good, or ſubſervient thereto: while there remains bitter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyings, animoſities and driving on of contrary intereſts by clandeſtine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances, the deadly feud continues: when men treat and carry fair in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon civilities one with another, when they huckſter and barter by the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of commerce or trade, yet their heads and hearts are at an irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſtance; this cannot in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian be called quietneſs, it is rather ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure injuſtice or uncharitable diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>7. There can be no ſufficient ground given for the total repeal of Laws firſt made upon good grounds, where there is not ſufficient ſecurity given that all
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:100221:114"/> thoſe for whom theſe were intended have renounced thoſe principles which were the firſt occaſion of making them; becauſe the reaſon thereof ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, while no good ſecurity is given, or if any be tendered, 'tis deluſory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the greateſt ſatisfaction be given as to their ſincerity, which can hardly be ſuppoſed, if their Oaths and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations cannot be ſafely truſted.</p>
                  <p>This is home to the Papiſts, but juſtly applicable to the Puritans, who are ſo far from giving good ſecurity, that they give counter-ſecurity, in the worſt ſenſe, obſtinately perſiſting in their ſchiſmatical Separation from the Church whereof they are Members, and in their defiance to the Laws of the Kingdom. For either they utterly refuſe a ſubmiſſion to the firſt declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby they declare, they will give no ſecurity, or elſe collogue with it, taking it <hi>propter lucrum ceſſans,</hi> or <hi>damnum emergens,</hi> which is clearly to give no full ſatisfaction as to their Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, becauſe this they doe not in obedience to authority, but to drive on an intereſt. Theſe therefore are not ſafely to be truſted; and as they
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:100221:114"/> juggle with this, ſo with the Second, either refuſing to engage not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the King and his Government, or Jeſuitizing upon all the Clauſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as may appear fully from theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing remarks.</p>
                  <p>The firſt period is, It is not lawfull upon any pretence to take up Arms againſt the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reſervation is, as the caſe now ſtands, for that he will not part with the <hi>Militia,</hi> or as long as the King is in a condition to defend himſelf, and protect his Subjects, which they will by all means endeavour to render im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to doe, if not, we have no obligation to be ſubject; For we have been taught, and are perſuaded, that ſubjection and protection are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives; and therefore where protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not afforded, nor can be expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſubjection is no duty.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, I do abhor that trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Poſition of taking up Arms by his Authority againſt his Perſon.</p>
                  <p>The ſecret evaſion to this is, yea, till we receive a farther light, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence otherwiſe determine, or the Patriots vote to the contrary. Godly
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:100221:115"/> Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> rightly ſtated the caſe, the <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Presbyterian ſtinted us a time, for ſo long as he is the Peoples Truſtee, which he is not, if he fail in his truſt, whereof the good People are the Judges, and if he be depoſed, we need neither to reſpect his Perſon nor his Authority.</p>
                  <p>The third is, I will conform to the Liturgy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reſervation is, though we are not free, yet for once we can and will conform, becauſe we ſhall thereby ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our Places and Offices, and keep our Employments and Truſts, and be in a condition to befriend the Clanns who have canvaſſed hard for us, and better enabled us to drive on an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and manage a Plot.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is, I do hold there lies no obligation upon me or any other perſon from the Oath commonly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The evaſion is, very right, if we make uſe of any eternal force or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent reſiſtence; but for all that, we may meet, draw Diſciples after us, form Parties, inveigle Confederates, hold correſpondence and receive intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence from the <hi>Whiggs;</hi> but this is
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:100221:115"/> farther to be obſerved (which mark we beſeech you) though we will not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any alteration of Government upon the ſcore of the Covenant, yet there is an obligation ſo to doe from other principles, <hi>Nature's Dowry, &amp;c.</hi> with many impertinent Maximes, and mangled Precedents; but eſpecially from that connatural and gratefull thing which we call Self, ſuch as Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſervation, Self-intereſt, Self-conceit, and twenty Selfs more, which we muſt not part with for a world, as we are inſtructed by pretious men from good Book-caſes.</p>
                  <p>The laſt is, The ſame was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull Oath, and impoſed upon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here many of them ſtick, but they will plunge through, ſuch experienced Maſters are they in the craft of ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, they will make or find an hole to creep out at, when cloſely beſet. Some dare pretend an unlawfull Oath is ſtill obligatory, others plead the Oath was lawfull as the times went, the then preſent Laws were on their ſide. But that blunt blade ſpoke the ſenſe of the Guzmans, who ſaid, Oaths whether they were taken or not have
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:100221:116"/> no effect; For (ſays he) if the matter be antecedently lawfull, it remains ſo after the Oath, and then whether it be taken or not, the obligation is no more nor leſs than it was before the taking, which is to ſay in plain Engliſh, If we renounce the Solemn League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, yet the matter being antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently lawfull, they are obliged not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the abrenunciation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to adhere thereto; others of them again have a faculty to conjure up a ſet of diſtinctions, to evade the force of any Oath, as <hi>Pryn, Marſhall, Downing,</hi> who tell you, either inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations muſt be put upon them, or they will not bind againſt the work of Reformation, the end of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant muſt be purſued, ſwear what we will to the contrary. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> ſtood cloſe for the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but he diſputed as hotly againſt the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as <hi>Mattheus Tortus,</hi> alias <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> ever did. The <hi>Anonymus</hi> true Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt, will allow the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to be taken, provided it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by the Covenant, which may not be croſſed; but he bids open defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:100221:116"/> to the Oath of Supremacy as an Antichriſtian badge. King <hi>James</hi> found by experience, along while ago, no Oaths will bind them; we have greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to believe his experience, having had far more trials of their falſeneſs and inſincerity than ever he had; even the Covenant it ſelf will not hold them if it be their intereſt and advantage to break it, becauſe it is the Reſolution of their own Caſuiſts, That an Oath obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not in the ſenſe of the impoſer but the taker; but, which is much more monſtrous, ſome of them aſſert, That the ſwearer is neither bound to the meaning of him who exacts the Oath, nor to his own meaning who takes it, but to the reality of the thing ſworn, as it ſhall be hereafter at any time explained by a competent Judge. All their Declarations, Remonſtrances and Appeals to heaven and the world are but mockeries contradicted by prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
                  <p>8. Some love to pretend that a ſmall alteration in eſtabliſhed Laws would ſatisfie them, to try, if by theſe arts they could bring the wiſedom of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to yield to them in that, and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:100221:117"/> when they have obtained it, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand objections would be raiſed that never before were mentioned.</p>
                  <p>This is a right Puritan prank, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented in the late times of confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in our preſent circumſtances; ſeveral matters have been ſtarted which at firſt they never ſo much as dreamed on, certainly never ſpoke of them. So much hath been already yielded as would not onely ſatisfie but endear any modeſt meek perſons under their circumſtances, but we are never a whit the nearer that mark which was aimed at in thoſe condeſcenſions. Nay yield what you can with honour and conſcience they will preſently make odd conſtructions of the grant. Some fanſie it a work of God in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of them towards another turn, and then they will fall in with the firſt opportunity; others ſay, God will not ſuffer their Reformation-work to fail, for they have a ſtock of prophecies and promiſes to aſſure them of ſucceſs; others conclude the granters would not be ſo favourable unto them, unleſs they were ſenſible of their own weakneſs, and therefore let us fall on and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:100221:117"/> the good old Cauſe, and in a little time all will be our own. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch moderate projects be put to trial, in the iſſue they will be found unpracticable. They are pretty plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant fancies and ſpeculations to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick contrivers, very ſtrange amuſing things to the vulgar, and fine matters of diſcourſe to the buſie inquiſitive; but when they come in good earneſt to be tranſacted, the matter is ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and intricate, ſo many <hi>quaeres</hi> are propoſed, ſo many difficulties to be reſolved, ſo many intereſts to be ſerved, that they ſpend time to bring forth a Mouſe, and after much expence of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the pitifull projectours break up, are diſſolved, and quite daſhed out of countenance; all the ſatisfaction they can give themſelves, and all the excuſes they can make to others, comes barely to this, They had a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, there was honeſty at the bottom; but men value their intereſts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation at ſo high a rate, (as one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Sage obſerveth) they will not buy the truth (that's the naked truth indeed) and peace with the loſs and damage of theſe.</p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:100221:118"/>
                  <p>9. It is not wiſedom nor ſafe to give toleration to Wolves among Sheep, till they abate their monſtrous unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs, renounce their Oaths, and give ſecurity of their good behaviour in not ſeducing others.</p>
                  <p>This the Leaders of the Puritan Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will never doe, they are bound by their principles to engroſs Godlineſs and Saintſhip to their party, and by their intereſts never to renounce their Oaths, nor give over their crafts of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</p>
                  <p>10. If new Laws be made more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate to our preſent State, yet all care ought to be taken and caution uſed that our Church be not left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſecurity by Law againſt ſo violent and dangerous a party. For we have little reaſon to believe that they who bid defiance to our preſent Laws, and make ſport with Proclamations, will be perſuaded by gentler means to obey others.</p>
                  <p>Both the adverſe parties are violent and dangerous, and in the other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars equally criminal.</p>
                  <p>11. No true Son of the Church will envy the quiet and ſecurity of innocent
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:100221:118"/> and peaceable men, when there is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that by favour received they will not grow more unquiet, but we cannot take too great care to prevent the reſtleſs deſigns of thoſe who aim at nothing more than the undermining and blowing up of our eſtabliſhed Church.</p>
                  <p>This the Puritans have done, razing down the foundations thereof, even to the ground, and all thoſe who refuſe to ſubſcribe, and give ſatisfaction as to their ſincerity, are labouring with might and main to demoliſh it again. And not it onely, but even to deſtroy Monarchy, and extirpate not onely the Prieſtly but the Kingly Office; For ſo long as the nineteen Propoſitions, the Votes of Non-addreſſes and the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation appear againſt them, this can be no Calumny. Nay, their aims go higher, than to the blowing up of our eſtabliſhed Church, even to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of all Religion. For to my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion there is as great a difference between the Popiſh and Puritanical deſigns, as between the perſecution of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Julian;</hi> the former kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Prieſts and Chriſtian Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:100221:119"/> but the latter plotted and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the deſtruction of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Chriſtianity it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore what Archbiſhop <hi>Whitgift</hi> foretold, Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> foreſaw, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> declared, and King <hi>James</hi> hath obſerved of this Sect, is fully made out in every period of time ſince they prodigiouſly appeared, it were good to follow King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt his Counſel, Never to truſt them.</p>

            <p>IT is known the foregoing Diſcourſe was prepared ſeven years ago; if any inquiſitive perſon would be ſatisfied, why it was not expoſed to the publick then, and why now; let him know, it would have been judged unſeaſonable then, when moſt mens heads and hearts were full of thoughts about the Popiſh Plot, which doubtleſs had wickedneſs enough in the deſign, and inward reſerves. Some would have ſaid it was uncharitable, becauſe it ſwells with hard words (as they are commonly phraſed) which would have been as hardly cenſured by thoſe, who favour, or endeavour to palliate the unrighteous dealings of thoſe, who have hardned their hearts againſt all convictions and reprooſs. It will be hard for theſe men to prove, that it is
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:100221:120"/> ſin to call a Traitour a Traitour, a Schiſmatick a Schiſmatick, a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite a Hypocrite, though it be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to prove all that are ſo called to be ſuch indeed. S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath told us there were Traitours in his days, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6. whoſe folly ſhould be manifeſt to all men, <hi>v.</hi> 9. and that after they would wax worſe and worſe, <hi>v.</hi> 13. Now if this great Apoſtle thought ſuch ſhould be detected to their ignominy, a good reaſon ſhould be aſſigned, why our Diſſenters and Republicans with their herd of <hi>Politico's</hi> (who have been Traitours to all intents and purpoſes, if ever there have been any ſuch in any age or quarter of the world) ſhould not be branded with that title they have demerited. The ſame holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle termed thoſe of the Conciſion Dogs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 2. becauſe they rent the Church in pieces by their Separation, and may not we beſtow the ſame figure on the Schiſmaticks of this Church, who ceaſe not to ſnarl and bark, and, when they dare, bite and devour the men worthy that is with them in this diſtinguiſhing note, the King and Biſhops with all truly loyal Subjects? What S. <hi>Aug. l.</hi> 3.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:100221:120"/> 
               <hi>adv.

You will do poſſibly what you can for our ruin, ſeeing you ceaſe not to be doing when you can doe nothing at all. But I humbly conceive fairer pleas and pretences may be made for the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts of the Circumciſion, than can be contrived for the preſent Diſſenters; and I believe thoſe Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, whom S. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> called a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Vipers, were not a brood of ſo venemous Creatures, as the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of theſe be. Our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour bids his Diſciples beware of falſe Prophets, as of ravening Wolves; but theſe will never be known ſo as to be marked and avoided, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts, unleſs ſome marks be ſet upon them; now who ſhould doe this, but they who are charged to diſcover the Wolves, and as Watchmen and Shepherds to give notice of their approach, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they appear in their aſſumed counterfeit harmleſs habit? Indeed great zeal is pretended to keep out the Roman Wolf, and ſome over-wiſe
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:100221:121"/> projectours ſeem to think the ſureſt way to effect this, is to let in other grievous Wolves; make an Union, joyn in an Aſſociation and in a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and offenſive League with them, who have once driven this Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Wilderneſs; when all <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſcattered upon the hills as Sheep that had no Shepherd. But others much more wiſe, and truly moderate than they, did believe that would make a ready way for the Conclave Wolf to catch his prey, whereof if he miſſed, we ſhould, under pretence of ſtopping one gap, ſet open an hundred gates to miſery and confuſion, by bringing in a vaſt number of damnable Hereſies, and an unaccountable Schiſm. It may be remembred, that not long ſince, as the vogue went, there was a deſign to unite the Roman and Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which though it was much more honourable and piouſly Chriſtian, than this ſo lately upon the ſtocks, and as it is to be reaſonably ſuppoſed ſtill endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by double-minded and unſtable men, who are given to change, and by abſurd and unreaſonable men, who count gain godlineſs; yet this way
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100221:121"/> was by the troublers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> cried down as a politick fetch and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance for the reduction of Popery; notwithſtanding their great Bell-wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had declared, that, that deſire of reconciliation with <hi>Rome,</hi> was with ſuch additions, as might bear a tolerable ſenſe, and for his part, he was perſuaded, the Papiſts were as much afraid of King <hi>Charles</hi> (well fare him for this) and the Grotian deſign, as of any thing that of a long time had been hatched againſt them: But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever may be ſaid either againſt, or for that, the late balderdaſh project muſt not take. For we are reſolved to ſtand in defence of our Divine Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, nor will not be contented with a titular Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> King, who may bear the name, but God knows who ſhould go away with the authority. Neither can we part with our Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, Catholick Epiſcopacy to take a day, (it will not be of much longer ſtanding) of truce with thoſe who have forfeited their Faith with God, the King and the Church; nor will we be pleaſed with an ambulatory, or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous Creed, nor with an arbitrary
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:100221:122"/> monſtrous ſuperintendency voted, and unvoted, and revoted backward and forward, according to the ſenſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the Chairman and his crew in S. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Chapel; Neither will we be ſatisfied or own a civil or common Law hotch-potch Church, according to the device of the Counter-plot (as the three Inventors gave it a Name, one whereof is an outlawed Traitour, the ſecond a Church Trepanner, the third a giddy Changeling.) For I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Was the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when Popiſh, a true conſtituted Church according to its firſt ſettlement by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and ſubſequent example of the Primitive Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ſo eſtabliſhed by Law, or not? If it were, we have done the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts buſineſs, they need not prove us, we have proclaimed our ſelves Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, in ſeparating from a true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Church by Chriſt's and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles order, antecedently ſuch before any humane Sanction; if not, then a legal ſettlement may be Antichriſtian, which in that very reſpect ſtands in great need of a Reformation. For as to attempt a Reformation of that which
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:100221:122"/> is founded on Divine Authority, and ſtands by Divine Law, is a contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the indiſpenſable and irrevoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble will of the Founder, ſo to reform what hath been introduced by mere humane authority, without any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty either general or ſpecial from a grant of our Law-giver, is a pious Chriſtian duty, provided that in the management thereof nothing be done repugnant to any other Divine Law, and our duty. But let what can be ſuggeſted for the promotion of this new project, it will be baffled by the two notorious Ringleaders of the Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For if Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> onely true way of concord will not paſs, he and his Comrades will be as clamorous and ſtirring, if they dare, as ever. <hi>J. O.</hi> is poſitive, All lawfull things are not to be done for the Churches peace, which quite undoes it.</p>
            <p>Confeſſed it muſt be that ſeveral of the Partiſans conceive a full union can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expected, yet to comprehend, and condeſcend to thoſe, who will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally and partially conform, may go far towards a peace. In good time! can this be a way to true Chriſtian
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:100221:123"/> peace, when Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath given us fair warning not to truſt them, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly telling us, <hi>Apol. for Nonconf. p.</hi> 90. they are onely Inſtruments to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine us, and will turn againſt us, as ſoon as they have opportunity. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will their coming to Church, as they deluſorily and hypocritically call it, clear them from the guilt of Schiſm, becauſe this Church being both foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſettled upon Divine Right in all its Superſtructures, there ariſes an obligation conſtantly and throughly to communicate with it, and obſerve its Rules and Orders, which not to doe, is ſinfull Separation, and to abett or countenance thoſe who doe not, is to partake of their ſin. For it is not love, devotion or duty which draws them, but cunning, intereſt and fear which drives them to this outward auckward conformity. The beſt any can make of it, its an act of compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, cannot be an act of Chriſtian al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance and obedience to lawfull Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, which is a work of Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate with the other good works of Faith, iſſuing from the ſupernatural power of God's Word, Spirit and Grace.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100221:123"/> Certain it is, that the men for whom this favour is moved, do pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and honeſtly declare (which is next to a moral impoſſibility that they ever will) that Kingly power is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and immediately from God, that Prelatical Epiſcopacy is a Divine Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Inſtitution, that ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and adjuncts in the external miniſteries of Divine Worſhip not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly preſcribed by God may and ought to be adhibited therein for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, order and edification, they are not to be truſted; and if frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences will not make us ſo wiſe as to neglect them, and all ſuch motions for them, we are fit to be begged and once more undone.</p>
            <p>We are yet again efforted with a troop of <hi>tantum nons,</hi> who are ſtill bleating for connivence, forbearance and moderation; which in effect is to ſolicite the Laws be outlawed, though herein they would give better evidence of their moderation and modeſty, if they left that ſolely to the reſolution of the Government. Take theſe we muſt as we find them, and we ſhall find them vary as the wind does, they
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:100221:124"/> can blow hot and cold with one breath, that trimming Proverb is their Rule, There is no living at <hi>Rome,</hi> and figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the Pope, and let the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſink or ſwim, they will keep themſelves out of harms-way. If poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to make ſure of this world, they will have friends of all parties; for which end, they can at preſent ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Oath of Allegiance, take the Teſt, and upon another occaſion vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a fulſome Remonſtrance, Addreſs, or Aſſociation; but by all means they will make infallible proviſions for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in order whereto, if they be in health, they are for the Church, and if in ſafe policy they may, for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle too; yea from the Church to a Conventicle, and back again; if ſick, they will not refuſe the Offices of the Church, but will admit them <hi>de bene eſſe;</hi> yet for their <hi>tranſire</hi> and <hi>viati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> they muſt have a voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived prayer by a moderate Sneak, who can play faſt and looſe with the Church Offices, and to make ſure work, the Sacrament muſt be re-admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by one of the ſame batch, or a zealous Holder-forth. In my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100221:124"/> theſe of all other Sects are the moſt dangerous, becauſe the more cloſe and reſerved, we cannot ſay they are either fleſh or fiſh, nor diſcover whether they be Hawk or Buzzard, they are <hi>animalia imperfectè mixta;</hi> but this we know, much miſchief hath hapned by this falſe diſguiſed, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called moderation; to evidence which, it will be requiſite to exemplifie this in ſome (all are too numerous and would be too bulky) inſtances, and to give in the opinion of two, who in their times were reputed moderate learned men, and excellent preachers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It hath been miſchievous to the Church; The Samoſatenian Hereſie was brought in under a miſtaken cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable pretence to reconcile the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Religion. The Hereſie of the Monothelites was ſet up on a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to moderate the Hereſie of <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</hi> The Euſebians propagated the Arian Hereſie by their moderate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to compoſe the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and the Catholicks. Some Novatian Biſhops, to ſatisfie the ſcruple of a convert Jew, thought fit to leave
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:100221:125"/> it (though the matter of it was an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved practice) as a thing indifferent, which ſoon raiſed a Schiſm, and this Schiſm in a ſhort time begot another. <hi>Theoph. Alex.</hi> favoured the Originiſts in hope to recover ſome at leaſt from that Sect, but S. <hi>Hier.</hi> told him round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his moderation therein was very offenſive to holy men, becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he emboldned and ſtrengthned the (already) over inſolent and peeviſh Faction. What <hi>Greg. Naz.</hi> got, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſt by his eaſineſs of temper is too large to relate, and ſo it is of many more. Theſe are ſufficient to ſhew, that whoſoever they be that follow ſuch moderate courſes, are in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe, who heal the hurt of the daughter of God's people ſlightly, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 11. whoſe words will eat as doth a canker, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 17. which if it be not ſpeedily remedied will infect the whole body, and prove mortal; they are like thoſe who ſow pillows to all arm-holes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 18. but moſt like thoſe, <hi>Ez.</hi> 34. 18. who eat up the good paſture (yet cry out ſadly of hunger and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution) and tread down the reſidue, who drink of the deep waters, and foul the reſidue with their feet.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:100221:125"/>2. It hath reached to civil Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons too; Not to ſeek for foreign, we have had too ſad experiences of it at home. It was moderation which ſet all the villanous Factions of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom a-gog, by the advantages which the State-menders (who certainly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended thoſe miſerable deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which enſued) gave them; this appears, in that when ſome had raiſed the evil Spirit, it was not in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to lay it, as it hapned to <hi>Titus</hi> his Souldiers at the ſacking of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> all his authority could not put a ſtop to their fury. Indeed endeavours were uſed to ſtop that iſſue of bloud which had fatally weakned and conſumed the vitals of the Kingdom then weltering in her gore, by ſome, who generally were very worthy men, yet proved Phyſicians of no value: what occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or rather cauſed this miſcarriage and ſad conſequence, will be beſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted by what his late Sacred Majeſty in his Declaration concerning the Treaty of <hi>Oxford</hi> obſerved of them. They had light enough, but wanted heat, they at once diſliked and countenanced the bloudy Rebels, their tameneſs made
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:100221:126"/> them conſiderable, and their too much diſcretion would undoe them; which ſoon hapned, ſo that they who hated them became Lords over them, they were a prey to thoſe of whom the moſt Reverend Primate <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> was wont to ſay, They had Guts enough but no Bowels; and we may truly apply that of <hi>Solomon, The tender mercies</hi> [marg. <hi>bowels] of the wicked are cruel, Prov.</hi> 12. 10. but if their cruelty had been exerciſed onely upon them who had affronted them, the condition of the Kingdom had not been ſo lamentable; but it extended from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba,</hi> every ſupplanting and ſucceeding Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taking their turn to pull down and deſtroy whatever was ſacred, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable or honeſt, that our caſe was perfectly the ſame with thoſe in <hi>Petron. Arb. Omnes nobiſcum aut corvi qui lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, aut cadavera quae lacerantur.</hi> Now that the moderate ſet theſe inſtruments on foot, might eaſily be demonſtrated; Dr. <hi>Bates, Elench. Mot. p.</hi> 2. has given us the names of ſeveral of them, with a general deſcription of their tempers, humours and qualities.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:100221:126"/>3. In our preſent caſe, moderation tends to the diſſolution and ſubverſion of the Government. The Diſſenters are tools and inſtruments of which the Papiſts make great uſe, and theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate are the Abettours, Patrons and Protectours of the Diſſenters; all that can be expected from the moderate in relation to the Government, is in any exigence to leave it in the lurch, if we hope to find from them any real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, or faithfull endeavours, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any Conſpiracies or Aſſaults upon it, we are (before we be aware) got to a fools Paradiſe, we ſhall again be at <hi>Ferguſon</hi>'s title, <hi>No Popery, no Tyranny,</hi> or at <hi>College</hi>'s Motto, <hi>No Popery, no Slavery,</hi> which in the ſenſe of the <hi>Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s is no King, no Biſhops, or at beſt, a precarious King and Biſhops; to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond which wicked policy moſt of the ſtirring Addreſſers will once more with their lives and fortunes engage to make good all the proteſtations of their trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Patriots. It is probable, from <hi>Holoway</hi> and others, though the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate were not throughly acquainted with the very particulars of the late execrable Conſpiracy, yet, they knew
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:100221:127"/> by clandeſtine correſpondence, and the figure of affairs, ſome deviliſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was a-ſpawning, which they kept cloſe to themſelves, and would have ſtifled it from others, to play their own part according to the ſucceſs or diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of it. The Papiſts could not be ſo dangerous as they are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and too juſtly feared, if the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were quelled, becauſe they then would be utterly diſappointed of the many advantages they gain by their Schiſmatical, and rebellious principles and practices; The Diſſenters can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be rampant, unleſs they be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldned and aſſiſted by the moderate, who by their covetouſneſs, connivence, cowardiſe or hypocriſie, keep their heads above water that they ſink not; and their hearts and hands that they neither faint nor flag. This is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for one bigotted Papiſt there are an hundred over-grown zealot Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, both which labour on all hands to level the Crown and the Church, but for an hundred Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks there are a thouſand moderate Mammoniſts, who will never endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſupport them unleſs upon force
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:100221:127"/> and with reluctancy, which when they doe, they doe it perſunctorily, perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſcarce to half part. This is our hope againſt theſe evil men; he that keepeth <hi>Iſrael</hi> neither ſlumbers nor ſleeps, who hath delivered from ſo great a death, as they have vainly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, and doth deliver, in whom we truſt that he will yet deliver us. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. As this humour hath been miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous to the publick, ſo to private perſons amongſt us, who were no way engaged but by prayers and tears for the eſtabliſhed Government. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry excellent Biſhop <hi>Davenant</hi> told Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour <hi>Ward,</hi> when he ſaw what his and other mens moderation was like to produce, he was aſhamed to live: he with others had oft interceded with the Government for moderation towards the Faction, but now (1641) he ſaw ſuch immoderate courſes taken by them, that the moſt irreligious things were done under pretence of Religion, <hi>Memoires, p.</hi> 281. The ſame Authour tells us, Biſhop <hi>Potter</hi> complained, he had lived to ſee himſelf deſpiſed by them he had countenanced; he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceded
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:100221:128"/> ſo long for liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with the King, till he ſaw neither the King nor himſelf could enjoy their own, that he feared the pretenee of Religion would overthrow the reality, and the diviſions of that Age would breed Atheiſm in the next. I could nominate Biſhop <hi>Morton, &amp;c.</hi> all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, learned and holy men. The King obſerved, that they who counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him by a politick moderate Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime to ſign the Bill for beheading the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> were ſo far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the rewards of ſuch ingratia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings with the people, that no men have been more haraſſed and curſhed than they; he onely, <hi>&amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, c.</hi> 2. This I believe, if it were throughly examined, would be found a certain truth, that all of the nobility (one onely excepted) who ſuffered death for the King and the Church by the Sentence of their Courts of Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, were ſuch as at firſt took trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming meaſures, leaving us a while to play at Blind-mans-buffet, till we came to cutting of throats. I am ſure there was a Book not long after entituled, <hi>Lex Talionis,</hi> which made ſhrewd diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries.</p>
            <pb n="235" facs="tcp:100221:128"/>
            <p>Secondly again, I ſhall give you the opinions of the two Divines before hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the firſt is Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> who thus delivered himſelf in a Sermon on <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 10, 11. Not onely the great ſins of the profane, but the coldneſs of them that are otherwiſe good, cauſeth the Lord to remove the Candleſtick, the old complaint may be now taken up, The fire which before was hot, is now onely light, and <hi>p.</hi> 291. If we profeſs the cauſe of God, why go we coldly about it? if it be not the cauſe of God, why do we not deſert it? yea but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and moderation muſt be uſed! It's true, but doth one grace croſs ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Prudence doth not abate our love, but guides it in its labour, as for moderation it ſtands in avoiding the rock, in declining the extremes, but moderation in a good courſe is not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration but coldneſs and lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The ſecond is Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi> in his <hi>Gen. direct. for comfortable walking with God, p.</hi> 50. who thus declares, Many unſanctifie themſelves by making mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration a Saint, and undoe their Souls by adoring diſcretion as an Idol. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:100221:129"/> and diſcretion truly ſo called and rightly defined, are ornaments to the moſt zealous Chriſtians, but being tempered with coldneſs, and edged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fervency of the Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the very deſperate cut-throats of the power of godlineſs, a peſtilent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the ſpirits, heart and life of true zeal. It will be confeſſed, they thus wrote in reference to the Papiſts, who (as they conjectured) were too much favoured; But if the Diffenters be as dangerous to the Government, and as pernicious to the Souls of thoſe who are taken in their nets, (which plain matter of fact demonſtrates) then theſe cenſures are as applicable to them. For every Schiſm and rebellion carries in its boſome the tranſgreſſion of all God's Commandments, if our Book of <hi>Homilies, III. Rebellion</hi> (which <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate thinks the next beſt Book to the holy Bible) inform us aright, and if he, or any other deſigning make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate can ſay worſe of the Papiſts, let them doe it. There is another Authour, who, it ſeems, by the often reprinting of his Book, was once in great credit; it is Mr. <hi>Shepherd,</hi> who, in his <hi>Sincere
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:100221:129"/> Convert, prin. an. 50. Ed. 5ta. p.</hi> 159. ſpeaks home to the caſe, his words are, Of the nine eaſie ways which men take to heaven, but lead to hell, the eight is that of moderation, or ſober deſcretion, which is nothing elſe, but lukewarmneſs of the Soul, when a man contrives and cuts out ſuch a way to heaven as to pleaſe all and diſpleaſe none, if they be rich eſpecially, or in power. In <hi>p.</hi> 165. he falls heavily upon fawning Miniſters, who in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons do moſtly ſhoot a few pot-guns againſt ſome groſſer ſins, but will not tell them roundly of their <hi>Herodias, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>p.</hi> 207. ſays, Thus they cheat the people by their general dawbing Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, who conclude themſelves to be honeſt religious men, becauſe their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter hath given them a beggarly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port for heaven, and ſo they go out of this world, and die like Lambs, being wofully cheated. Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> did not like any ſhould be more moderate than Chriſt our great Exemplar and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, who uſed ſeverity upon thoſe who upheld an old cuſtome profanely and for their avarice, at two ſeveral times, <hi>Matt. 21. 12. Joh.</hi> 2. 13. which
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:100221:130"/> execution S. <hi>Hier.</hi> looks upon as an evidence of his miraculous power, in that none made any reſiſtence; and <hi>Muſc.</hi> notes, none before did ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, though the Law and cuſtome was over-ruled, <hi>Matt.</hi> 11. 13. In ſum the Lay prudential moderate in times of diſtraction and action will for the moſt part (all but the Caballers) ſtand ſtill, as lookers on, till they ſpie the time moſt for their purpoſe, then if the Faction get uppermoſt, they will ſtrike in, go along with it, and to looſe no time will take the advantage of the firſt turn, in their common lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and practice. The Clergy will now and then ſpeak of Conformity, making uſe of ſuch arguments as would make an honeſt, well-meaning Soul more averſe; for ſcarce a word comes from them of obeying for Conſcience<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, moſtly to ſubmit for the Laws ſake, or Peace ſake, which is to ſay, its good policy at preſent to conform. Again, they will for ſhame of the world ſay ſomething for Loyalty, upon the Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> the Thirtieth of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> or the Nine and Twentieth of <hi>May</hi> (very rarely at other times, be the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:100221:130"/> occaſions never ſo urgent) and vent ſome general looſe expreſſions, as all parties conſent in, and will ſerve for the purpoſe of a Republick or a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, for an Uſurper or their natural Liege Lord, and then ſlur over the moſt pernicious principles of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by no means will declare of what denomination they are who aſſert thoſe principles, and purſue the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces conſequential to them; when they ſpeak moſt home, yet to come off fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the populace, they have two tricks to pleaſe and to cheat them, the firſt is an Application or Uſe, to make an Harangue againſt Drunkenneſs, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, Swearing, Sabbath-breaking, and other univerſally condemned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries; we know their full aim in this, (as they would have it taken) malicious, hypocritical ſlander, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe they do not ſay any thing at all againſt lying, ſlandering, pride, malice, covetouſneſs and hypocriſie; which as they are the more reigning, ſo the more dangerous to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and more deadly in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>propter eorum latentiam</hi> (as <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi>) for their cloſe ſculking within the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:100221:131"/> Soul, that it ſeldom or never is ſenſible of them; no ſooner have theſe deviliſh deadly ſins taken poſſeſſion, but the poſſeſſed begin to ſettle on their lees, and ever after ſit in the ſeat of the ſcornfull; for then the Conſcience is concerned, and the pretence and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of Conſcience hardens them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all admonitions and reproofs, <hi>Matt.</hi> 21. 31, 32. The other trick is to cloſe all with an Exhortation, to Union, Charity and Forbearance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if they have a good meaning, it's a pure impertinency; if a bad meaning, it's a piece of hypocriſie, and a ſcurvy reflexion on the Government: both Lay and Clergy will occaſionally talk at a conſiderable rate for Loyalty and Conformity <hi>ad amoliendum periculum,</hi> the danger of the Law, and ſuſpicion of their inſincerity; but on all other occaſions where no danger of Law, as in the Election of Repreſentatives, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pannelling of Juries, hooking in a rich Widow for one of the Tribe, or procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a confiding cologuing Prieſt to be admitted upon a Vacancy into a Church, they then are tooth and nail for Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or ſome moderate Diſſemblers.</p>
            <pb n="241" facs="tcp:100221:131"/>
            <p>It may be foreſeen with half an eye, ſome will ſay, all this needed not to be ſo tediouſly and unſeaſonably ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added; to this it's ſoon replyed, when the Traitours in <hi>Scotland</hi> had made a large progreſs in their rebellious cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſome took the liberty to talk free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the danger this Kingdom was in, the rather becauſe the Engliſh Sectaries and Republicans held correſpondence with them, as ſince it hath been evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proved. Now how was this monition taken and interpreted? Some ſaid they could not believe the Engliſh did contribute to thoſe ſtirs (ſo Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion was ſmothered) and it was irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to believe they would; as for the Scots, they did ſtir, but it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they in their conceits were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and under fears and jealouſies (by their own guilt if they were ſo) ſhould be more oppreſſed; others from which much better (if it had been within) might have been expected, ſſighted the relation, and cenſured the relatours to be ſhort-ſighted men, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer men than they knew better things. But I ſhall here demand, Whether thoſe wiſe men did apprehend any danger
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:100221:132"/> from theſe ſtirs, or no? If they really did, they were very indifferent men, the trimming humour was predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in them, they had friends on both ſides, and would not be concerned in either; If they did not, then they were the ſhort-ſighted men. I will not ſay, whoſe eyes the God of this world had blinded, but they were in our Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern expreſſion, moon-blind, or blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded: ſhould a man tell theſe wiſe men now, the ſtirs are not yet laid or ended, he would be cenſured; but let them think or ſay their worſt, there is ſome reaſon to perſuade, that in all probability the Conſpiracy is not yet dead, they are in hopes it will revive, for if any diſcourſe thereof, they may obſerve the wiſe ſober men uſe ſuch ſhruggs, and make ſuch ſhruggs, and make ſuch faces, their very countenance and motions betray them, but over and above we know, it's not Conſcience but deſign which keeps theſe men from a full ſubmiſſion to the Government and obedience to the Laws; they are men of intereſt, have working brains, and would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtick to give the Government all ſatisfaction, if they did not hope to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:100221:132"/> effectuate their deſigns at long run. This the wiſe ſober men will not deny, that they who are dull, heavy and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe in the execution of Law, when the King and Law is for them, will never be forward and active to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the publick peace, intereſt and tranquillity, when the caſe is hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous, and King and Law like to be oppreſſed.</p>
            <p>But it will be demanded, how will you come off in this bold adventure of expoſing theſe men of renown (ſuch as <hi>Corah</hi>'s Complices) whom wiſe and good do careſs and complement? If they do ſo I cannot help it, but for my own part, I think they ought to be expoſed, for theſe reaſons,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all <hi>Iſrael</hi> may hear and fear, and doe ſo no more.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The moſt probable way to keep out Popery, is to keep down Purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm. The right reverend Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> obſerved, None gained by the ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diviſions and practices in this Realm but Hell and <hi>Rome,</hi> the Devil and the Pope; and if theſe men be countenanced and permitted to follow
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:100221:133"/> their old ways, we may expect the ſame fate; they that court them, or but dally and play at bo-peep with them, do not onely encourage but tempt them to perſiſt in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs and obſtinacy, which is as great a kindneſs and ſervice as the Pontifician Politicoes can deſire or can be done for them. <hi>Contzen's Politicks, l.</hi> 2. cited in <hi>Fair Warning, part. 2. c. 2. Sect.</hi> 1. As much advantage is to be made by the Proteſtants diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as of the Papiſts concord, to extirpate Proteſtants, <hi>p.</hi> 33. This was the Popiſh old Plot by <hi>Campanella</hi> in his Book <hi>De Monarchia Hiſpan.</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our Monarchy, and was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> in his advice which he gave a little before his death to the French King; and for the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of Epiſcopacy, <hi>Io Paean</hi>'s were ſung at <hi>Rome,</hi> and Father <hi>Sibthorp</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt diſcovery of that reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his Letter to Father <hi>Medcalf,</hi> ſaid, Now they are pulling down that Wall which at once adorned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended their way. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was of the ſame deſtructive opinion; for as he did agree with Father <hi>White</hi> in pulling
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:100221:133"/> down the Bulwark of Monarchy; ſo with Father <hi>Sibthorp</hi> to pull down the Wall of Epiſcopacy: onely with this difference, that Father <hi>Sibthorp</hi> would endeavour to pull it down becauſe it both adorned and defended the Church; but Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was for demoliſhing the Wall, becauſe (in his account) it was a Wall of Separation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon reſolved to doe the beſt he could, while he lived, to pull it down, and to make it the moſt earneſt action of his life to prevent the re-building of it, Mr. <hi>Baxt.</hi> 3d. <hi>Defence, Part</hi> 2d. <hi>p.</hi> 84. Now it will be confeſſed, that if <hi>Rome</hi> got any thing the Devil gained too.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Devil, the firſt Schiſmatick and Rebel, will ſtill endeavour to make as many as he can by his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine wiles to be as bad and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as himſelf, neither will he ſuffer thoſe whom he hath once taken Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive at his pleaſure to loiter in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but keep them at hard duty; neither are there any more captivated by him, than thoſe who ſerve him in a Rebellion, wherein they fight his Battels under God's Colours; for this is like the ſin of Witchcraft, once a
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:100221:134"/> Witch, always a Witch, once a Rebel, always a Rebel. I have read it as a Maxime in Law, <hi>Semel malus ſemper malus in eodem genere mali;</hi> and we have reaſon to believe our old and late Rebels will never relent. For,</p>
            <p n="4">4. They cannot endure to hear any thing ſpoken of Rebellion, they ſit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie when that Theme is proſecuted home; all their aims are, not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear what they are, and to appear what they are not, their buſineſs in the world is to carry fair, (in their own cant) and therefore it's no hard meaſure to pay them what they have deſerved; if wiſe and learned good men have forbore to reflect on them, they are either ſuch who have not ſeen, or felt their ſtudied arts of barbarous cruelties and impieties, and they may give looſers and ſufferers leave to ſpeak; or ſuch, who are ſwayed with a tranſport of good nature, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of a miſtaken prepoſterous chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but by their good leave to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a few roving Privateers to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and detriment of the publick is no office of charity, nor act of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. King <hi>James</hi> hath told us, Good
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:100221:134"/> deeds will never gain them; we are ſure ever ſince they have been fruitleſs: It's very unlikely then good words, which are but wind, will ever doe it; and if neither good words nor good deeds will ſtill them, an experiment of hard words and deeds may doe the feat, at leaſt ſtop them in their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier. To fob them up with ſoft words, is a way, as to flatter them, ſo, to keep up their credit and reputation with the multitude and common ſort of people, which as it is to doe half their work for them, ſo to render the Government odious and ſuſpected. Doubtleſs when they tell us they are his Majeſty's moſt faithfull, loyal and obedient Subjects, and then upon the firſt opportunity break out into open Rebellion, we may truly call them Traitours and Hypocrites, which are as hard words as can be uſed, and if they may not be uſed, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented to no purpoſe. But to ſalve the matter, ſome have found out a moderate way of compounding it, by joyning an hard and ſoft word toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, calling them diſſenting Brethren. For as the former is a very ungratefull,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:100221:135"/> unſociable and offenſive word, ſyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous to Recuſant, Separatiſt and Schiſmatick; the other is a ſweet, pleaſant and comfortable appellative. Now I cannot yet underſtand why the ſame may not be attributed to Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, unleſs partiality or popularity prevail too much. For the relation is founded either on Nature, Profeſſion or Office, which are the common ways of appropriating that title, but they are our Brethren by Nature, as Men, by Profeſſion, as Chriſtians, (Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> confeſſes them to be ſo) and ſure I am they are Miniſters of the Goſpel by deſignation and Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo that a reaſon ſhould be rendred why Father <hi>Garnet, Creſwell, Oldcorn, Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Gawen</hi> may not be dubbed Brethren as well as <hi>Smectym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuus,</hi> Brother <hi>Baxter, Owen, Lob,</hi> or <hi>Ferguſon.</hi> If Idolatry deſtroy the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity on one ſide of the Houſe, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege will on the other; if poſitive Superſtition break off the Brotherhood on the one hand, negative will on the other; if the Colliers Creed make us aſhamed of the relation, the no Creed, or no Determinate, will give us occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:100221:135"/> to grieve and mourn: if an impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Faith in the Church, or a blind obedience to the Pope, make us like to Horſe and Mule which have no underſtanding, then it will ſo happen, if we reſign our reaſon to the reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a pack of Demagogues; unleſs we at laſt be contented the Pope's Chair be removed to the Speaker's at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> with a <hi>Nemine Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cente.</hi> But to ſhut up all, it's an hard caſe when men will cenſure others in that wherein they themſelves are faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For theſe mellow ſoft Souls, when they are pinched or twitted, make uſe of words as hard in ſenſe, though not ſo harſh in ſound, and can for a Friend's ſake ſmother, ſtifle and excuſe their hard deeds; as if we were faln back into <hi>Jeoffrey Chaucer</hi>'s days, when words were ſins, but deeds were not. However, if any think I have been too rude or bitter againſt thoſe whom I believe upon good grounds to be dough-baked Ephraamites, King-haters, Church-Mountebanks, Interlopers, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours, a moſt prodigiouſly ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full profligate Sect, let them, I ſay, who think ſo, prove it by good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:100221:136"/> and reaſon, I will confeſs and amend, which is all the Reformation I yet know is needfull to them who live, and are reſolved (by God's grace) to die, in the Communion of this moſt Chriſtian, Apoſtolical Catholick Church.</p>
